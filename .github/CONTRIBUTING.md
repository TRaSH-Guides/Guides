# Contributing Guidelines

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

Here you will find a set of guidelines for contributing to TRaSH Guides, Which you can find [HERE](https://trash-guides.info/),
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Guidelines

- Make sure you're editing the latest version.
- If you propose changes make sure it doesn't break anything else in the Guides.
- Make sure that after the changes you don't get any [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md) errors
- If the `metadata.json` and `metadata.schema.json` needs changes, announce it first in the Discord `#development` channel and ping`voidpointer` and `nitsua` so the 3rd party apps don't break :bangbang:

## Branch naming

We're trying to be as consistent as possible for automation of the changelog.

- **feat/xxx** Commits, that adds a new feature
- **fix/xxx**  Commits, that fixes a bug/issue
- **style/xxx** Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **chore/xxx** Miscellaneous commits (administrative / cleanup / backend)

Where 'xxx' can stand for Starr/Sonarr/Radarr/Guide etc

*Examples:*
`feat/Starr-ELEANOR-to-Scene-CF`
`feat/Radarr-CiNEPHiLES-to-Remux-Tier-02`
`feat/maintenance`
`fix/dv-hdr10-cf-should-match-dv-hdr10+`
