# How to update Custom Formats

Here I will try to explain how you can manually update Custom Formats for Radarr v3+, With any changes from the guide or changes provided to you from other sources, without losing the scoring in your Quality Profile.

## How to Copy/Paste the JSON

The manual way is almost the same as the Import Custom Format way found [HERE](/Radarr/Radarr-import-custom-formats/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

### In Radarr

`Settings` => `Custom Formats`

### Open the Custom Format you want to update

### Paste the Custom Format

In the empty `Custom Format JSON` box (1) you just paste the `JSON` that you got from the [Custom Format Collection](/Radarr/Radarr-collection-of-custom-formats/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} or provided to you from other sources followed by the `Import` button (2).

### Save the Custom Format

After selecting the `Import` button you will get a screen that has all the Custom Format variables filled in correctly, all you need to do now is click on the `Save` button and you're done.

!!! warning "The Import to update existing Custom Formats replaces the existing Custom Format, so all manual changes you did to it will be lost :warning:"

### TRaSH Sync

This can be done also automatically with one of the TRaSH Sync Applications,
