# How to rename your folders

If you need to rename your current folder names (for example, to a new naming scheme), you can do so with a little "magic trick".

![!radarr-wrong-folder-name](images/radarr-wrong-folder-name.png)

Simply go to the movie overview section.

`Movies`

Click on `Edit Movies` (at the top)

![!radarr-movie-editor](images/radarr-movie-editor.png)

Once you are in "edit" mode, you can select the movie(s) whose folders you want to be renamed.

![!radarr-movie-editor-select](images/radarr-movie-editor-select.png)

1. If you want all your movie's folders to be renamed with the new naming scheme you set [HERE](/Radarr/Radarr-recommended-naming-scheme){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
1. Select the movie(s) that you want to have the folder(s) renamed.
1. At the bottom select `Edit`

A new popup will be shown:

![!radarr-edit-selected-movies](images/radarr-edit-selected-movies.png)

Choose the same (current) root folder for your selected movies, and choose `Apply Changes`.

![!radarr-movie-editor-move-files-yes](images/radarr-movie-editor-move-files-yes.png)

You will get a warning popup where you will need to choose `Yes, Move the files`

!!! warning

    If you have a large library, use remote or cloud storage, or your path structure isn't well planned (or doesn't support instant moves) this could take a while.

    **Make sure you don't interrupt this process.** If it stops before it has been completed, it could result in quite a mess.

Then, Magic!

As you can see, the folder has now been renamed to the new/updated naming scheme.
