## Installation

Information sourced mostly from [Deluge's Downloads Page](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)

### Windows

You can find the latest Windows installers [here](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/deluge/windows/?C=M;O=D)

!!! note

    `lt2.0` in the filename means the installer includes libtorrent 2.0.x instead of the older 1.2.x

### Linux (Native)

Due to most default OS repositories being outdated, I recommend using Deluge's repositories to install the latest version.

Using `apt-get` to install

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deluge-team/stable
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install deluge

Using `pip3` to install (included in the Python package)

        pip3 install deluge
