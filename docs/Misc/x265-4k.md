## Some extra info about 4K/X265

[4k, transcoding, and you - aka the rules of 4k - a FAQ](https://forums.plex.tv/t/plex-4k-transcoding-and-you-aka-the-rules-of-4k-a-faq/378203){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - Plex.tv

1. Don’t bother transcoding 4k
1. If you cannot direct play 4k, then perhaps you should not even be collecting 4k.
1. If you don’t have the storage space for a copy of both 4k and 1080/720, then perhaps you should not even be collecting 4k.
1. To avoid transcoding for remote and non-4k clients, keep your 4k content in separate plex libraries.
1. This may of course mean that you keep a 4k copy and a 1080/720 copy, but if you are collecting 4k content then you should not be worried about storage space, should you?
