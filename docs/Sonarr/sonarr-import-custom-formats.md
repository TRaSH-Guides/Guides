# How to import Custom Formats

Here we will try to explain how you can manually import Custom Formats for Sonarr v4+.

!!! info "Keep in mind Custom Formats are made to fine-tune your Quality Profile.<br>Generally, quality trumps all"

## How to Copy/Paste the JSON from the site

In this example, we will use the [{{ sonarr['cf']['br-disk']['name'] }}](/Sonarr/sonarr-collection-of-custom-formats/#br-disk){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} Custom Format, the one most people don't want to download anyway. And if you do, then you probably don't use any of the Starr apps or Plex, being both don't support it.

Visit the [Collection of Custom Formats](/Sonarr/sonarr-collection-of-custom-formats/){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and select [{{ sonarr['cf']['br-disk']['name'] }}](/Sonarr/sonarr-collection-of-custom-formats/#br-disk){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} from the table.
