# Release Profile RegEx (WEB-DL)

Sonarr V3 has a great feature called Release Profile.
With this option you can fine tune your preference.

The Release profile that we're going to use for this example is mainly to prefer P2P releases over Scene releases. (Scene releases are still being downloaded, but replaced once an upgrade is found.)

??? question "FAQ - [CLICK TO EXPAND]"

    ## FAQ

    **Q: Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL?**

    A: I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between quality and size and you often don't see big differences anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc)

    **Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene groups?**

    A: Scene groups always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible.

    So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality.
    P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release.
    Also, I noticed that with some scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio.

    In my opinion the P2P releases are of better quality.
    There's one scene group that does bring out quality releases `-deflate/-inflate`.

    **Q: Why do I see so many repacks/propers of Amazon WEB-DLs lately?**

    A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially.
    The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated, the episodes will be REPACKED.

    **Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups?**

    A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile. I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why? Lately I noticed a lot of popup scene releases meaning we need to update often.

    With this it also means all scene and (yet) unknown groups will be getting a score of `0` and not `-50`.

    I will still keep a eye on them and add the Low Quality Groups to the `-100` score and when I find a new P2P group I will add them, resulting in less updates and a more accurate upgrade.

------

## Propers and Repacks

First we're need to make sure a P2P release isn't being replaced by a Scene Repack/Proper release!

![!rp-settings-media-management-proper](images/rp-settings-media-management-proper.png)

Go to `Settings` => `Media Management`
We´re going to set it to `Do not Prefer`.

Then we navigate to `Settings` => `Profiles` and click the plus sign.

![!rp-settings-profiles](images/rp-settings-profiles.png)

You will get a popup screen that will look like this:

![!rp-release-profile](images/rp-release-profile.png)

1. `Must Contain` => add words that the release name **MUST HAVE!**

1. `Must Not Contain` => add words that the release name **MUST NOT HAVE OR IT WILL BE REJECTED!**

1. `Preferred` => add words you prefer with a certain score. The release will be preferred based on each term's score.

1. `Include Preferred when Renaming` => When you add `{Preferred Words}` to your renaming scheme it will add this info.

1. `Indexers` => Specify what indexer the profile applies to.

1. `Tags` => create a tag so this is only used by shows that you give this tag to or else it's global.

------

!!! summary

    The Number between the **[**brackets**]** in the following release profiles are the scores the release name will get during an automatic and manual search and with the use of the scores some releases will be preferred over others and even upgraded.

    The Number between **(**brackets**)** in the following release profiles are referring to the location where you should add this regex in the release profile corresponding the screenshot above.

!!! important
    We're going to make use of four separate release profiles.

## Release Sources (Streaming Service) - Release Profile

<sub>Profile 1</sub>

<!-- [trash_id: a0e7774a471e041d4f1111e0690244d0] -->

!!! note

    Check mark `Include Preferred when Renaming` and add `{Preferred Words}` to your renaming scheme or else you could get download loop issues!!!

    What it does:

    When enabled, the block with the [Release Source (Streaming Service)](#release-source-streaming-service) in it are then added to the file name which fixes any loops due to Sonarr seeing a new NF rip when an AMZN rip is found.
    Probably doesn’t happen if cutoff is met, but for anything that is unmet or any forced searches it results in a loop because NF is not in Sonarr’s copy so it upgrades, and loops.

    Enabling the include in preferred words for AMZN and adding that to the file name fixes that.

### Golden rule

!!! attention ""
    :bangbang: This one is actually a must even that it's added in the optional section :bangbang:

??? question "Why the Must Not Contain entry - [CLICK TO EXPAND]"

    This one blocks/ignores 720/1080p releases that are (re-)encoded in x265.

    So why did I put `/^(?=.*(1080|720))(?=.*((x|h)[ ._-]?265|hevc)).*/i` as `Must Not Contain` and what does it do ?

    Why ?

    !!! quote
        x265 is good for for 4k stuff or 1080p if they used the the remuxes as source.
        If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time.
        Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done.
        It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality.

        Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support.
        If you have more than a couple users,
        you will notice much more transcoding.
        Just depends on your priorities.

        So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265.
        The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes.
        If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later,
        then x264.
        It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people

    It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases. And the few groups that do use the correct source suffer from it.

    That's why  I created my own golden rule.

    - 720/1080p => x264
    - 2160p/4k => x265

Add this to your `Must not contain (2)`

```bash
/^(?=.*(1080|720))(?=.*((x|h)[ ._-]?265|hevc)).*/i
```

#### Optional - Ignore Dolby Vision without HDR10 fallback

    This is a RegEx that ignores DV that don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup.

```

#### Optional - Ignore Bad Dual Audio Groups

??? question "WHY ? - [CLICK TO EXPAND]"

    These groups take the original release, then they add their own preferred language (ex. Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first.
    Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese.

Add this to your `Must not contain (2)`

```bash

### A little explanation of the scores and why

- Scores [75]-[100] Release Source.
- Scores [125]-[150] P2P Groups.
- Scores [10] Give a repack/proper a higher score but don't trump P2P groups for a Scene fix.
- Scores [-25] Retagged/Renames/Obfuscated  releases.

    !!! danger ""
        If you're getting often a error message like `Has the same filesize as existing file`, you might need to consider to remove the [-25]

- Scores [-100] Groups that mess with the audio or add another preferred language.

Optional => We've tested it and it worked for what we've tested it on, if it will work in your situation we don't know.

If you notice something wrong just contact me and we will try to fix it or remove it.

[^1]:

    The reason why this one get's such a high score is because it's the only quality scene group that exist (till now) and scene groups don't add the [Release Sources (Streaming Service)](#release-sources-streaming-service) to their release name so they don't get the extra point of the release source regex.
