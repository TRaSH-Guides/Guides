# Collection of Custom Formats

Below is a collection of what we've come to regard as the most needed and commonly used Custom Formats.
These CFs have been collected from discussions on Discord or created with help from others.

Special thanks to everyone that has helped in the creation and testing of these Custom Formats, my team at TRaSH guides, and the community.

Sonarr V4+ introduces Custom Formats. These are much more advanced/powerful than the release profiles, although this also means a Custom Format can require more knowledge to set up or create.
We've made 3 guides related to this.

- [How to import Custom Formats](/Sonarr/sonarr-import-custom-formats){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - Explains how to import the Custom Formats.
- [How to upgrade Custom Formats](/Sonarr/sonarr-how-to-update-custom-formats){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - Explains how to upgrade your existing Custom Formats.
- [How to setup Quality Profiles](/Sonarr/sonarr-setup-quality-profiles){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - Explains how to make the most use of Custom Formats and shows some specifics of my configuration. You can use these examples to get an idea of how to set up your preferences.

!!! tip

    It also is recommended to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Sonarr's `Settings`.

    `Media Management` => `File Management` to `Do Not Prefer` and use the [Repack/Proper](#repackproper) Custom Format.

    ![!cf-mm-propers-repacks-disable](images/cf-mm-propers-repacks-disable.png)

    This way you make sure the Custom Format scoring and preferences will be fully utilized.

### DTS X

??? question "DTS:X - [Click to show/hide]"

    [DTS:X is an object-based audio codec](https://www.whathifi.com/advice/dtsx-what-it-how-can-you-get-it), which aims to create a multi-dimensional sound that “moves around you like it would in real life”.
    You may think that sounds a lot like Dolby Atmos, and you’d be right. But where DTS:X differs lies in the required speaker configuration. While Dolby Atmos requires you to add extra overhead channels to your 5.1 or 7.1 setup, DTS:X works with standard surround speaker setups – just like the one you might already have at home. It can support up to 32 speaker locations and up to an 11.2-channel system.
    DTS:X like other higher quality DTS formats (e.g. DTS-HD MA) is lossless.

??? question "DTS-HD MA - [Click to show/hide]"

    [From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTS-HD_Master_Audio){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

    DTS-HD Master Audio is a multi-channel, lossless audio codec developed by DTS as an extension of the lossy DTS Coherent Acoustics codec (DTS CA; usually itself referred to as just DTS). Rather than being an entirely new coding mechanism, DTS-HD MA encodes an audio master in lossy DTS first, then stores a concurrent stream of supplementary data representing whatever the DTS encoder discarded. This gives DTS-HD MA a lossy "core" able to be played back by devices that cannot decode the more complex lossless audio. DTS-HD MA's primary application is audio storage and playback for Blu-ray Disc media.

### BR-DISK

??? question "BR-DISK - [Click to show/hide]"

    This is a custom format to help Sonarr recognize and ignore BR-DISK (ISO's and Blu-ray folder structure) in addition to the standard BR-DISK quality.

    You will need to add the following as a new Custom Format, and when created adjust the scoring in your Quality Profile (`Setting` => `Profiles`) to `-10000`.

    !!! note

        Depending on your renaming scheme Sonarr could potentially match renamed files AFTER they are downloaded and imported as `BR-DISK`,
        This is only a cosmetic annoyance until we come up with another way to solve this,
        Because this Custom Format is used to exclude downloading of BR-DISK, it is still behaving as intended.

        Potential reasons why this is could occurr:

        - Blame the often wrongly used naming of x265 encodes.
        - Sonarr v3/v4 uses dynamic custom formats.

### Bad Dual Groups

??? question "Bad dual groups - [Click to show/hide]"
    These groups take the original release and add their own language (ex. Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe is that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as the first track.
    Also they often even translate/rename the release name to Portuguese.

### DV (WEBDL)

<sub>DV = DoVi = Dolby Vision</sub>

??? question "DV (WEBDL) - [Click to show/hide]"
    This is a special Custom Format that blocks WEBDLs **with** Dolby Vision but **without** HDR10 fallback.

    You will need to add the following as a new Custom Format, and when created adjust the scoring in your Quality Profile (`Setting` => `Profiles`) to `-10000`.

    This Custom Format works together with the normal [DV](#dv) Custom Format that you would use to prefer Dolby Vision.

    Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10. What can result during playback is issues with weird colors (typically a green hue) when you attempt to play it on a non Dolby Vision compatible setup.

    Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10.

??? example "JSON - [Click to show/hide]"

### No-RlsGroup

??? question "No-RlsGroup - [Click to show/hide]"

    Some indexers strip out the release group which could result in LQ groups getting a higher score.
    For example, a lot of EVO releases end up stripped of the group name so they appear as "upgrades" and they end up getting a decent score if other things match

    !!! warning

        If you don't use decent filenames (like not adding release groups) don't add this Custom Format, except if you want to upgrade them.

### Season Pack

??? question "Season Pack - [Click to show/hide]"

??? question "Season Pack - [Click to show/hide]"

    This blocks most 720/1080p (HD) releases that are encoded in x265.
