# Setup proxy for certain indexers

It's not recommended to run the Starr apps through a VPN, what can happen is that the Starr apps doesn't update the posters or metadata or you can't add new movies/tv shows, it doesn't need to happen right away. but sooner or later it can and probably will happen.

!!! danger "To be clear it is not a matter if VPNs will cause issues with the Starr Apps, but when: image providers will block you and cloudflare is in front of most of Starr servers (updates, metadata, etc.) and liable to block you too"

Just run VPN on the apps that actually need it, like your torrent client, and perhaps in some cases certain indexers because of region/ISP restriction.

!!! warning

    Please check the indexers rules if you're allowed to use a VPN/Proxy to access their site, being that VPN services often use shared IP it could be recognized as account sharing.

    This isn't the same as the tracker, the API/Website scraping happens on the actual site and some indexers don't allow VPN usage on their site.

In this guide i will try to explain how to setup Prowlarr to use your VPN from your torrent client.

## Enable privoxy

If you use docker you need to enable enable privoxy in you torrent client so you can use it to passthrough traffic.

Please check your used docker image how to enable privoxy.
