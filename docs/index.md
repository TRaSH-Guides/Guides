*TRaSH Guides, Guides that aren't trash.*

Here you will find guides mainly for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr and everything related to it.

## How this all started

When I started using Sonarr/Radarr, I noticed that it didn't grab the releases that I actually wanted, as I'm a bit picky about which releases and what quality I prefer.
So I decided to fine tune it to try to get the releases & quality I preferred. On Discord, I also noticed that others run in to the same issue so I explained them how I managed to get it solved. Being that I had to explain it often, I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link it to someone when they needed it.
After a while I also decided to create guides for frequently asked questions, and started to collect all kind of information gathered from various sources.
I try to make my guides as easy as possible for everyone to understand, in my opinion pictures explain often more than just some text.

### DISCLAIMER

The information I use for the guides is information I have gathered from different sources like support forums, Reddit or Discord, provided by user input or from the development teams.
I have tested most things myself and I have tried to see if I could tune them a bit more to my needs and sometimes even for others.

You use everything here at your own risk. I won't be responsible if something happens to your setup or collection!
