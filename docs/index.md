_TRaSH Guides, Guides that aren't trash._

Here you will find guides mainly for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr and everything related to it.

## How this all started

When I started using Sonarr/Radarr, I noticed that it didn't grab the releases that I actually wanted (I'm a bit picky about which releases and what quality I prefer).
I decided to fine-tune my quality profile settings to try and get the releases and qualities I preferred. While on Discord, I noticed that others ran into the same issue, so I explained how I managed to solve this. Once I started having to explain more often, I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link to it when needed.
After a while I _also_ decided to create guides for frequently asked questions and started to collect all kinds of information gathered from various sources.
I try to make my guides as easy as possible for everyone to understand and, in my opinion, pictures often explain more than just some text.
