# How To Set Up

In this section, you will find several how-to guides for installation of the Starr Apps.
This is all done in a way to achieve [Hardlinks and Instant Moves (Atomic-Moves)](/File-and-Folder-Structure/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/).

Select your desired method of installation:

- [Docker](/File-and-Folder-Structure/How-to-set-up/Docker/)
- [Dockstarter](/File-and-Folder-Structure/How-to-set-up/Dockstarter/)
- [Native](/File-and-Folder-Structure/How-to-set-up/Native/)
- [Synology](/File-and-Folder-Structure/How-to-set-up/Synology/)
- [TrueNAS Core](/File-and-Folder-Structure/How-to-set-up/TrueNAS-Core/)
- TrueNAS Scale users can follow the same concepts as the Docker method, until someone provides a guide and is willing to maintain and give support for it in the Guide Discord.
- [Unraid](/File-and-Folder-Structure/How-to-set-up/Unraid/)
- [Windows](/File-and-Folder-Structure/How-to-set-up/Windows/)
