Here you will find Guides mainly for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr and everything related to it. How this all started \u00b6 When I started using Sonarr/Radarr, I noticed that it didn't grab the releases that I actually wanted, as I'm a bit picky about which releases and what quality I prefer. So I decided to fine tune it to try to get the releases & quality I preferred. On Discord, I also noticed that others run in to the same issue so I explained them how I managed to get it solved. Being that I had to explain it often, I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link it to someone when they needed it. After a while I also decided to create guides for frequently asked questions, and started to collect all kind of information gathered from various sources. The guides I make I try to make them as easy as possible for everyone to understand, in my opinion pictures explain often more then just some text. Support \u00b6 If you have questions, suggestions, requests or want to contribute, Click the chat badge to join the Discord Channel where you can ask your questions directly or use the following link to open a issue on GitHub. Feel free to create a PR if you want to. DISCLAIMER \u00b6 The information I use for the guides is information I have gathered from different sources like their support forum, Reddit or Discord, provided by user input or from the development team itself. I have tested most things myself and I have tried to see if I could tune them a bit more to my needs and sometimes even for others. You use everything here at your own risk. I won't be responsible if something happens to your setup or collection!

[ Long answer ] Hard links are a way for a copy operation to be instant and not consume space for those additional copies. Every file is a hard link: some metadata that points at blocks on the file system, which is why they're restricted to the same file system . There can be as many metadata files pointing at those blocks as needed and the blocks know how many links point to them. Once the blocks have 0 links, they're considered deleted. This means: You can delete any \"copy\" w/o impacting the others. Your download client can remove it's \"copy\" w/o impacting the library \"copy\". The library \"copy\" can be removed by Plex or Sonarr/Radarr or yourself w/o impacting the download client \"copy\". Space is only regained when all \"copies\" are deleted. Modifying the file will impact all \"copies\". For example, modifying the id3 tags of a .mp3 download after import would modify the download client \"copy\", resulting in breaking the torrent.

I've also created a short guide HERE where I explain the settings for the most used applications. The main goal of DockSTARTer is to make it quick and easy to get up and running with Docker. You may choose to rely on DockSTARTer for various changes to your Docker system or use DockSTARTer as a stepping stone and learn to do more advanced configurations. DockSTARTer was actually my first steps in to the world of dockers. Note I'm not going to explain how to get dockers installed and running, I will only explain which folder structure we recommend. The paths mentioned below refer to internal paths for the containers! External paths depends where you mounted your share or your drives. For example /<path_to_data>/data , or even /data . Info The paths you use on the inside matter. Because of how Docker\u2019s volumes work, passing in two or three volumes such as the commonly suggested /tv , /movies and /downloads makes them look like two or three file systems, even if they aren\u2019t. This means hard links won\u2019t work and instead of an instant move, a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used. Folder Structure \u00b6 Attention It doesn't really matter which path you use for your media and appdata, the only thing you should avoid is /home . Because user folders in /home are expected to have some restrictive permissions. It just could end up creating a permissions mess, so it's better to just avoid entirely. For this example we're going to make use of a share called data .

I've also created a short guide HERE where I explain the settings for the most used applications. The main goal of DockSTARTer is to make it quick and easy to get up and running with Docker. You may choose to rely on DockSTARTer for various changes to your Docker system or use DockSTARTer as a stepping stone and learn to do more advanced configurations. DockSTARTer was actually my first steps in to the world of dockers. Note I'm not going to explain how to get dockers installed and running, I will only explain which folder structure we recommend. The paths mentioned below refer to internal paths for the containers! External paths depends where you mounted your share or your drives. For example /<path_to_data>/data , or even /data . Info The paths you use on the inside matter. Because of how Docker\u2019s volumes work, passing in two or three volumes such as the commonly suggested /tv , /movies and /downloads makes them look like two or three file systems, even if they aren\u2019t. This means hard links won\u2019t work and instead of an instant move, a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used.","title":"Docker"},{"location":"Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Docker/#folder-structure","text":"Attention It doesn't really matter which path you use for your media and appdata, the only thing you should avoid is /home .

This is faster then the GUI and after installing, it shows up in the Docker GUI. Thanks to faxity for the initial compose that I used to create the Synology Guide. And a very big thanks to Bokkoman and BZwart that updated this Guide for DSM 7 and also offered their help on discord as Synology Support Team. Introduction \u00b6 This page will provide you with guidance on how to install several Docker images to your Synology system. We highly recommend to read the full guide, that way you have a better understanding of what you do, in case you later decide to make changes. Automated Script \u00b6 Automated script ( Use this script at your own risk ) - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Warning Though, we offer a short way out. This is intended as a quick way to do everything that is written on this page within one script. The script is new and only tested on Synology DSM7. We are not held reliable if anything breaks on your system. Use at your own risk To get this working you will need to enable terminal access (SSH). To enable this on your Synology take a look HERE . When you enabled the terminal access (SSH) run the following commands and follow the onscreen questions. curl -sL git.io/syno-script > ~/syno-script sudo bash ~/syno-script Install Docker \u00b6 You need to install Docker from the Package Center . This should also create a share named docker , check File Station if it is present. Create the main share \u00b6 Attention To get Hardlinks and Atomic-Moves working with your Synology you will need to make use of ONE share with subfolders. We will use a new share named data (lowercase) for all your library media. Later in this guide, we will fill this share with subfolders. To create a new share: Control Panel > Shared Folder > click Create > choose Create Shared Folder Name this shared folder data . You can disable the trash can. Click next until you are done. Create a user \u00b6 For this, we are going to create a new user that only has access to the share(s) that we use for this guide. Go to Control Panel > User & Group In the User section, create a new user. Name it whatever you like, but for this guide we will use docker . Fill out the rest of the information, generate a password or type your own. Click next, you will now be able to select which group this user will belong to, it should only be users . Click Next . Assign shared folder permissions \u00b6 In this screen you will be able to select which Shares this user will have access to, click No Access on the top, this will deny all access. Now only select Read/Write on the shares docker and data . Click Next until you reach Assign application permissions Assign application permissions \u00b6 In this screen you will be able to select which application this user will have access to, Check Deny for all applications. Continue to click Next until you are finished. SSH \u00b6 You are mostly going to use the terminal. Some parts will need the Synology web GUI. To enable terminal, you need to enable SSH in the Synology Settings. Control Panel > Terminal & SNMP > Enable SSH service Then use a program like Putty and you can SSH into your Synology. If you get a popup asking if you want to trust the key, Just press OK or ACCEPT Enter the login information of your main Synology user account. PUID and PGID \u00b6 In order for the Docker container to access the shares on the Synology, we need to know the user ID (PUID) and group ID (PGID) from the docker user we just created. Go into your terminal app, login to your synology ssh. Once logged in type id $user . Change $user to the newly created username docker . This will show you the UID (aka PUID). Which in this screenshot is 1035 for the docker user and the GID (aka PGID) which is 100 for the users group. Remember these values for later use. Attention It is not recommended to use (anymore) your admin/main user account. That is why we just created a new user. Folder Structure \u00b6 For this example we're going to make use of the share called data . On the host (Synology) terminal you will need to add /volume1/ before it. So /volume1/data The data folder has sub-folders for torrents and usenet and each of these have sub-folders for tv , movie and music downloads to keep things neat. The library folder has nicely named tv , movies and music sub-folders, this is your library and what you\u2019d pass to Plex, Emby or JellyFin. These subfolders you need to create your self.

Hard links will work and moves will be atomic, instead of copy + delete. data \u251c\u2500\u2500 torrents \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv \u251c\u2500\u2500 usenet \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv \u2514\u2500\u2500 media \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv Media Server \u00b6 Plex, Emby, JellyFin and Bazarr Plex, Emby, JellyFin and Bazarr only needs access to your media library, which can have any number of sub folders like Movies, Kids Movies, TV, Documentary TV and/or Music as sub folders. data \u2514\u2500\u2500 media \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv Don't forget to look at the Examples how to setup the paths inside the applications. Create the needed subfolder \u00b6 Here we will create the needed subfolders for your media library and also for your preferred download client. If you use both then run both commands If you use usenet \u00b6 sudo mkdir -p /volume1/data/ { usenet/ { tv,movies,music } ,media/ { tv,movies,music }} If you use torrents \u00b6 sudo mkdir -p /volume1/data/ { torrents/ { tv,movies,music } ,media/ { tv,movies,music }} Appdata \u00b6 Your appdata will be stored in /volume1/docker/appdata/{appname} These {appname} sub folders you need to create your self. ( This is a limitation of the Synology ) We're going to do this in Putty or a similar program. sudo mkdir -p /volume1/docker/appdata/ { radarr,sonarr,bazarr,plex,pullio } You can add your own sub folders for your download client(s) using the command above, by adding the name to the command. So your appdata folder will look like this. ls -al /volume1/docker/appdata docker \u2514\u2500\u2500 appdata \u251c\u2500\u2500 radarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 sonarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 bazarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 plex \u251c\u2500\u2500 pullio \u2514\u2500\u2500 (your download client, i.e. nzbget; sabnzbd; qbittorrent) Needed files \u00b6 Now we are ready to move to the installation of containers. For this, we need two files: docker-compose.yml .env We will start with downloading the docker-compose.yml file Download this docker-compose.yml to your /volume1/docker/appdata location so you got your important stuff together. Or use the command below: sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRaSH-/Guides-Synology-Templates/main/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -P /volume1/docker/appdata/ Whats included and Whats not included \u00b6 What's included and What's not included - [CLICK TO EXPAND] This docker-compose file will have the following docker containers included. Radarr Sonarr Bazarr (Subtitle searcher and downloader) Plex What's not included (and where are the download clients?). I didn't add a download client to it, because it depends on what you prefer (usenet/torrent) and which client you prefer, so I created a new Repository on Github where I provide and maintain some templates that are ready to use with the main docker-compose.yml . The only thing you need to do is copy/paste what's inside the .yml file in to the main docker-compose.yml , the template also has the command what you need to use to create the appdata folder that we explained earlier. Second we will download the .env file Download this .env to your /volume1/docker/appdata location so you got your important stuff together. Or use this command: sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRaSH-/Guides-Synology-Templates/main/docker-compose/.env -P /volume1/docker/appdata/ Attention MAKE SURE THE FILE KEEPS THE ORIGINAL NAME .env WITH THE DOT BEFORE IT Changes and preparations \u00b6 Tip If you need to edit docker-compose.yml or the .env file we advise to use Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code The .env file we downloaded holds the variables/information you need to change in order for everything to work. I added explanations in the .env file. DOCKERCONFDIR (only change this if you know what you're doing and decide to use another path than this guide used) DOCKERDATADIR (only change this if you know what you're doing and decide to use another path than this guide used) PUID/PGID (this info you got earlier from HERE TZ (Change to your timezone, can be found HERE Install and Create a task scheduler for Pullio, so your containers stay up to date. The .env holds more variables/information for other containers you don't need to remove those variables and will be only used when you install the other containers. Pullio - Auto update docker-compose the correct way \u00b6 Pullio allows you to automatically update your containers. And send you a notification through various means. In my setup, I use a Discord Webhook. First you need to download Pullio sudo curl -fsSL \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotio/pullio/master/pullio.sh\" -o /usr/local/bin/pullio sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pullio For Pullio to work, you will need to create in your Task Scheduler a \"Scheduled Task\" that runs for example at 4am at night with root privileges. Control Panel > Task Scheduler > click Create > choose Scheduled task - user defined script Give the task a name so you know what it does. Choose user root . In the Schedule tab choose whenever you want it to check for updates. At Task Settings tab, add the following line in the Run Command section: /usr/local/bin/pullio > /volume1/docker/appdata/pullio/pullio.log 2 > & 1 It can be frustrating to test the script if no docker image updates are available, for that you can run command sudo pullio --debug and the script will behave as if an update is available. If you have set to receive notifications, you should receive them. More info about Pullio HERE Permissions \u00b6 Now we need to make sure that the newly created files and folders have the correct permissions. Note If you're using a different user than docker (the user generated in the beginning), then you need to change the docker:users part in the commands below!!! sudo chown -R docker:users /volume1/data /volume1/docker sudo chmod -R a = ,a+rX,u+w,g+w /volume1/data /volume1/docker Note If you copy files from a different library into the newly created library, you need to rerun these commands. !!! Run the Docker Compose \u00b6 Important make sure you delete/remove all your existing dockers from the Docker GUI and also remove your native installs (in Package Center) of these applications !!! If you had previous installed apps, make a backup of their config folders. When you did all the above steps you only need to run the following commands: cd /volume1/docker/appdata sudo docker-compose up -d You will notice that all the images will be downloaded, after that the containers will be started. If you get a error then look at the error what it says and try to fix it. If you still got issues then put your used docker-compose.yml on 0bin and join the guides-discord here and provide the pastebin link with the error, have patience because of timezone differences. Don't forget to look at the Examples how to setup the paths inside your applications. Attention If you need to do any changes, only edit the docker-compose.yml file. To activate the changes, run the command sudo docker-compose -f /volume1/docker/appdata/docker-compose.yml up -d again. Any changes you do/did in the GUI will be reverted when you run the docker-compose command. Just don't use the GUI, only for information purposes !!! Docker-Compose Commands \u00b6 docker-compose commands - [CLICK TO EXPAND] sudo docker-compose up -d (This Docker-compose command helps builds the image, then creates and starts Docker containers. The containers are from the services specified in the compose file. If the containers are already running and you run docker-compose up, it recreates the container.) sudo docker-compose pull (Pulls an image associated with a service defined in a docker-compose.yml) sudo docker-compose down (The Docker-compose down command also stops Docker containers like the stop command does. But it goes the extra mile. Docker-compose down, doesn\u2019t just stop the containers, it also removes them.) sudo docker system prune -a --volumes --force (Remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and optionally, volumes.)

The paths mentioned below refer to internal paths for the containers! External paths depends where you mounted your share or your drives. For example /<path_to_data>/data , or even /data . Info The paths you use on the inside matter. Because of how Docker\u2019s volumes work, passing in two or three volumes such as the commonly suggested /tv , /movies and /downloads makes them look like two or three file systems, even if they aren\u2019t. This means hard links won\u2019t work and instead of an instant move, a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used. Folder Structure \u00b6 Attention It doesn't really matter which path you use for your media and appdata, the only thing you should avoid is /home . Because user folders in /home are expected to have some restrictive permissions. It just could end up creating a permissions mess, so it's better to just avoid entirely. For this example we're going to make use of a share called data . The data folder has sub-folders for torrents and usenet and each of these have sub-folders for tv , movie and music downloads to keep things neat. The media folder has nicely named TV , Movies and Music sub-folders, this is your library and what you\u2019d pass to Plex, Emby or JellyFin.

This is faster then the GUI and after installing, it shows up in the Docker GUI. Thanks to faxity for the initial compose that I used to create the Synology Guide. And a very big thanks to Bokkoman and BZwart that updated this Guide for DSM 7 and also offered their help on discord as Synology Support Team. Introduction \u00b6 This page will provide you with guidance on how to install several Docker images to your Synology system. We highly recommend to read the full guide, that way you have a better understanding of what you do, in case you later decide to make changes. Automated Script \u00b6 Automated script ( Use this script at your own risk ) - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Warning Though, we offer a short way out. This is intended as a quick way to do everything that is written on this page within one script. The script is new and only tested on Synology DSM7. We are not held reliable if anything breaks on your system. Use at your own risk To get this working you will need to enable terminal access (SSH). To enable this on your Synology take a look HERE . When you enabled the terminal access (SSH) run the following commands and follow the onscreen questions. curl -sL git.io/syno-script > ~/syno-script sudo bash ~/syno-script Install Docker \u00b6 You need to install Docker from the Package Center . This should also create a share named docker , check File Station if it is present. Create the main share \u00b6 Attention To get Hardlinks and Atomic-Moves working with your Synology you will need to make use of ONE share with subfolders. We will use a new share named data (lowercase) for all your library media. Later in this guide, we will fill this share with subfolders. To create a new share: Control Panel > Shared Folder > click Create > choose Create Shared Folder Name this shared folder data . You can disable the trash can. Click next until you are done. Create a user \u00b6 For this, we are going to create a new user that only has access to the share(s) that we use for this guide. Go to Control Panel > User & Group In the User section, create a new user. Name it whatever you like, but for this guide we will use docker . Fill out the rest of the information, generate a password or type your own. Click next, you will now be able to select which group this user will belong to, it should only be users . Click Next . Assign shared folder permissions \u00b6 In this screen you will be able to select which Shares this user will have access to, click No Access on the top, this will deny all access. Now only select Read/Write on the shares docker and data . Click Next until you reach Assign application permissions Assign application permissions \u00b6 In this screen you will be able to select which application this user will have access to, Check Deny for all applications. Continue to click Next until you are finished. SSH \u00b6 You are mostly going to use the terminal. Some parts will need the Synology web GUI. To enable terminal, you need to enable SSH in the Synology Settings. Control Panel > Terminal & SNMP > Enable SSH service Then use a program like Putty and you can SSH into your Synology. If you get a popup asking if you want to trust the key, Just press OK or ACCEPT Enter the login information of your main Synology user account. PUID and PGID \u00b6 In order for the Docker container to access the shares on the Synology, we need to know the user ID (PUID) and group ID (PGID) from the docker user we just created. Go into your terminal app, login to your synology ssh. Once logged in type id $user . Change $user to the newly created username docker . This will show you the UID (aka PUID). Which in this screenshot is 1035 for the docker user and the GID (aka PGID) which is 100 for the users group. Remember these values for later use. Attention It is not recommended to use (anymore) your admin/main user account. That is why we just created a new user. Folder Structure \u00b6 For this example we're going to make use of the share called data . On the host (Synology) terminal you will need to add /volume1/ before it. So /volume1/data The data folder has sub-folders for torrents and usenet and each of these have sub-folders for tv , movie and music downloads to keep things neat. The library folder has nicely named tv , movies and music sub-folders, this is your library and what you\u2019d pass to Plex, Emby or JellyFin. These subfolders you need to create your self.

In the usenet software settings, you\u2019ll need to reconfigure paths and you can sort into sub-folders like /data/usenet/{tv|movies|music} . data \u2514\u2500\u2500 usenet \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv The arr(s) \u00b6 Sonarr, Radarr and Lidarr Sonarr, Radarr and Lidarr gets access to everything because the download folder(s) and media folder will look like and be one file system. Hard links will work and moves will be atomic, instead of copy + delete. data \u251c\u2500\u2500 torrents \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv \u251c\u2500\u2500 usenet \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv \u2514\u2500\u2500 media \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv Media Server \u00b6 Plex, Emby, JellyFin and Bazarr Plex, Emby, JellyFin and Bazarr only needs access to your media library, which can have any number of sub folders like Movies, Kids Movies, TV, Documentary TV and/or Music as sub folders. data \u2514\u2500\u2500 media \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv Don't forget to look at the Examples how to setup the paths inside the applications. Create the needed subfolder \u00b6 Here we will create the needed subfolders for your media library and also for your preferred download client. If you use both then run both commands If you use usenet \u00b6 sudo mkdir -p /volume1/data/ { usenet/ { tv,movies,music } ,media/ { tv,movies,music }} If you use torrents \u00b6 sudo mkdir -p /volume1/data/ { torrents/ { tv,movies,music } ,media/ { tv,movies,music }} Appdata \u00b6 Your appdata will be stored in /volume1/docker/appdata/{appname} These {appname} sub folders you need to create your self. ( This is a limitation of the Synology ) We're going to do this in Putty or a similar program. sudo mkdir -p /volume1/docker/appdata/ { radarr,sonarr,bazarr,plex,pullio } You can add your own sub folders for your download client(s) using the command above, by adding the name to the command. So your appdata folder will look like this. ls -al /volume1/docker/appdata docker \u2514\u2500\u2500 appdata \u251c\u2500\u2500 radarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 sonarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 bazarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 plex \u251c\u2500\u2500 pullio \u2514\u2500\u2500 (your download client, i.e. nzbget; sabnzbd; qbittorrent) Needed files \u00b6 Now we are ready to move to the installation of containers. For this, we need two files: docker-compose.yml .env We will start with downloading the docker-compose.yml file Download this docker-compose.yml to your /volume1/docker/appdata location so you got your important stuff together. Or use the command below: sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRaSH-/Guides-Synology-Templates/main/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -P /volume1/docker/appdata/ Whats included and Whats not included \u00b6 What's included and What's not included - [CLICK TO EXPAND] This docker-compose file will have the following docker containers included. Radarr Sonarr Bazarr (Subtitle searcher and downloader) Plex What's not included (and where are the download clients?). I didn't add a download client to it, because it depends on what you prefer (usenet/torrent) and which client you prefer, so I created a new Repository on Github where I provide and maintain some templates that are ready to use with the main docker-compose.yml . The only thing you need to do is copy/paste what's inside the .yml file in to the main docker-compose.yml , the template also has the command what you need to use to create the appdata folder that we explained earlier. Second we will download the .env file Download this .env to your /volume1/docker/appdata location so you got your important stuff together. Or use this command: sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRaSH-/Guides-Synology-Templates/main/docker-compose/.env -P /volume1/docker/appdata/ Attention MAKE SURE THE FILE KEEPS THE ORIGINAL NAME .env WITH THE DOT BEFORE IT Changes and preparations \u00b6 Tip If you need to edit docker-compose.yml or the .env file we advise to use Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code The .env file we downloaded holds the variables/information you need to change in order for everything to work. I added explanations in the .env file. DOCKERCONFDIR (only change this if you know what you're doing and decide to use another path than this guide used) DOCKERDATADIR (only change this if you know what you're doing and decide to use another path than this guide used) PUID/PGID (this info you got earlier from HERE TZ (Change to your timezone, can be found HERE Install and Create a task scheduler for Pullio, so your containers stay up to date. The .env holds more variables/information for other containers you don't need to remove those variables and will be only used when you install the other containers. Pullio - Auto update docker-compose the correct way \u00b6 Pullio allows you to automatically update your containers. And send you a notification through various means. In my setup, I use a Discord Webhook. First you need to download Pullio sudo curl -fsSL \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotio/pullio/master/pullio.sh\" -o /usr/local/bin/pullio sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pullio For Pullio to work, you will need to create in your Task Scheduler a \"Scheduled Task\" that runs for example at 4am at night with root privileges. Control Panel > Task Scheduler > click Create > choose Scheduled task - user defined script Give the task a name so you know what it does. Choose user root . In the Schedule tab choose whenever you want it to check for updates. At Task Settings tab, add the following line in the Run Command section: /usr/local/bin/pullio > /volume1/docker/appdata/pullio/pullio.log 2 > & 1 It can be frustrating to test the script if no docker image updates are available, for that you can run command sudo pullio --debug and the script will behave as if an update is available. If you have set to receive notifications, you should receive them. More info about Pullio HERE Permissions \u00b6 Now we need to make sure that the newly created files and folders have the correct permissions. Note If you're using a different user than docker (the user generated in the beginning), then you need to change the docker:users part in the commands below!!! sudo chown -R docker:users /volume1/data /volume1/docker sudo chmod -R a = ,a+rX,u+w,g+w /volume1/data /volume1/docker Note If you copy files from a different library into the newly created library, you need to rerun these commands. !!! Run the Docker Compose \u00b6 Important make sure you delete/remove all your existing dockers from the Docker GUI and also remove your native installs (in Package Center) of these applications !!! If you had previous installed apps, make a backup of their config folders. When you did all the above steps you only need to run the following commands: cd /volume1/docker/appdata sudo docker-compose up -d You will notice that all the images will be downloaded, after that the containers will be started. If you get a error then look at the error what it says and try to fix it. If you still got issues then put your used docker-compose.yml on 0bin and join the guides-discord here and provide the pastebin link with the error, have patience because of timezone differences. Don't forget to look at the Examples how to setup the paths inside your applications. Attention If you need to do any changes, only edit the docker-compose.yml file. To activate the changes, run the command sudo docker-compose -f /volume1/docker/appdata/docker-compose.yml up -d again. Any changes you do/did in the GUI will be reverted when you run the docker-compose command. Just don't use the GUI, only for information purposes !!! Docker-Compose Commands \u00b6 docker-compose commands - [CLICK TO EXPAND] sudo docker-compose up -d (This Docker-compose command helps builds the image, then creates and starts Docker containers. The containers are from the services specified in the compose file. If the containers are already running and you run docker-compose up, it recreates the container.) sudo docker-compose pull (Pulls an image associated with a service defined in a docker-compose.yml) sudo docker-compose down (The Docker-compose down command also stops Docker containers like the stop command does. But it goes the extra mile. Docker-compose down, doesn\u2019t just stop the containers, it also removes them.) sudo docker system prune -a --volumes --force (Remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and optionally, volumes.)

This is something that can't really be answered because it depends on the use case and your personal preference. Here I will provide some suggestions and try to explain why I recommend these settings. Adjust it to your own liking and keep in mind that it is only a suggestion. I'm not a Plex Pro in anyway Attention Some settings are only visible for Plex Pass holders. All changes need to be done on your Plex Media Server. Why didn't you cover option .... ? I will only cover settings that I think might be interesting or are personal preference, if you would like me to cover some other settings, please contact me on Settings \u00b6 Remote Access \u00b6 Make sure you have enabled advanced settings (This will be needed for all the settings) Enable/Disable Remote access (if you disable it ignore the rest of these settings) LAN/container IP Public IP If you need to provide a screenshot always mask this IP Manually specify public port if you run Docker or want a fixed port. Enter the Plex port you want to use. (default: 32400 ) Click on Apply and when everything is setup correctly, your Plex Media Server should be fully accessible outside of your network, so you can connect to your Plex server from outside. You may also need to configure port forwarding on your router. Detailed instructions are available HERE . Enter your internet upload speed here and Plex can ensure it operates within this boundary. Set the maximum bitrate of a remote stream from this server. Agents \u00b6 This can be ignored if you use the new Plex agents, The new agent settings are now managed \u201cper library\u201d. Library \u00b6 Scan my library automatically \u00b6 When a change is detected in the source location for a library\u2019s content, the appropriate library will be scanned. This function relies on the computer\u2019s operating system providing the \u201csomething changed\u201d trigger. Some operating systems don\u2019t provide this trigger and content mounted via a network will also typically not work. If your library doesn\u2019t automatically scan, you may have to set a periodical scan or do it manually. Suggested: Enabled TIP - Autoscan - [CLICK TO EXPAND] If for some reason ex. your operating systems don\u2019t provide this trigger or your storage is mounted on a network (SMB/NFS/Cloud Storage) or your library just doesn't automatically scan, or is just plain impractical, You might want to consider using autoscan. IBRACORP (A Youtube channel I collaborate with) has a video explaining it in further detail. Please don't forget to check out his other Unraid Video's HERE Run a partial scan when changes are detected \u00b6 When changes to library folders are detected, only scan the folder which changed rather than scanning the entire content location. This works together with the normal Update my library automatically setting (and requires that setting to be enabled). Suggested: Enabled Include music libraries in automatic updates \u00b6 I don't do music, so this choice is up to you, and I won't be covering it. Scan my library periodically \u00b6 Turning this on will cause your Plex Media Server to run scans on your libraries using the designated interval. Suggested: Disabled Do you need a extra scan for your library to recognize new media? Empty trash automatically after every scan \u00b6 With this option enabled, when an item\u2019s file is deleted from the drive, it will be removed from the Plex library on the next scan. Disabling this option keeps the item in the library with an overlay over the item\u2019s poster when the item is removed. Suggested: Enabled Allow media deletion \u00b6 The owner of the server will be allowed to delete media files from disk. Suggested: Disabled In my opinion Plex shouldn't touch your media files. Use Sonarr/Radarr to manage your media library. (For extra security I've setup Plex with Read Only access to the media library) Run scanner tasks at a lower priority \u00b6 On low-powered systems (e.g. ARM-based NAS devices), it can be beneficial to run scanner tasks at a lower priority than other tasks. This can help ensure they do not interfere with regular streaming. Suggested: Enabled Makes sure it uses less resources and ensure they do not interfere with regular streaming. Generate video preview thumbnails \u00b6 This option creates a series of preview thumbnails from a media item when it is analyzed. These images are used by some Plex apps when you move back and forward in an app with the timeline scrubber. They\u2019ll also be displayed in Now Playing when someone is streaming from you so that you can see where they are in the video. Suggested: Never Besides that, it uses a lot of disk space and high I/O, No one in my family uses FastForward/Rewind but they use the skip forward/backward. ATTENTION Creating these images can Take a considerable amount of time Use a lot of CPU resources Increase the storage space used The images are stored in your Plex database location (/config) so be careful you don\u2019t fill the drive Generate intro video markers \u00b6 You can choose to have TV episodes analyzed to try and detect when the \u201cintro\u201d occurs during playback. When detected, apps will then offer a Skip Intro button, allowing you to quickly jump over the intro. Suggested: as a scheduled task or Suggested: as a scheduled task and when media is added Generate chapter thumbnails \u00b6 Chapter thumbnails provide images in the chapter view on supported apps. They can take a little time to generate and consume very minor additional disk space. Suggested: as a scheduled task or Suggested: as a scheduled task and when media is added Network \u00b6 Enable IPv6 support \u00b6 Enable IPv6 support. Suggested: Disabled If you're not sure your network 100% works with ip6 don't Enable it . Secure connections \u00b6 Choose how your Plex Media Server handles secure connections. Suggested: Preferred Accept and prefer secure connections when they\u2019re available for a Plex app, but allow regular HTTP connections if the app doesn\u2019t support secure connections or if one can\u2019t be established Preferred network interface \u00b6 For users with multiple network cards or systems such as NAS or Docker where there is always another network interface which Plex client applications may try to use to connect to the Plex Media Server, with this option you can ensure that your local Plex clients would only try that interface. Attention If you have enabled Remote Access enabled and are having Plex automatically map the port (as opposed to specifying a port manually), then Plex Media Server has no control over which network interface is used for an automatically-mapped port. Thus, it\u2019s possible that Remote Access connections could come through an interface other than the one specified here. Suggested: Whatever suits your setup Strict TLS configuration \u00b6 If this setting is enabled, it prevents Plex Media Server from using or accepting the deprecated TLSv1.0 and v1.1 protocols, as well as legacy weak ciphers. May prevent older clients from connecting. The vast majority of users will have no reason to enable this option (and receive no benefit from doing so). Suggested: Disabled Enable local network discovery (GDM) \u00b6 Enable \u201cG\u2019Day Mate\u201d discovery. This is used to allows Plex apps and servers to find each other automatically on a local network. Suggested: Enabled Remote streams allowed per user \u00b6 You can set the maximum number of simultaneous streams each remote user is allowed to have. Suggested: Whatever suits your setup LAN Networks \u00b6 It lets you specify which IP addresses or networks will be considered to be \u201clocal\u201d to you. Suggested: Your local IP/netmasks If your local devices are seen as remote devices, then this could solve your issue. (Do not include spaces or tabs.) Treat WAN IP As LAN Bandwidth \u00b6 Allows incoming requests from this network\u2019s WAN IP address to be treated as LAN requests in terms of bandwidth. This often occurs when DNS rebinding protection is in place and clients on the LAN cannot contact the server directly but instead have to go through the WAN IP address. Suggested: Enabled Enable Relay \u00b6 The Relay allows connections to the server through a proxy relay when the server is not accessible otherwise. Relay connections are bandwidth limited. Suggested: Disabled I've seen several reports where people that had this Enabled had playback issues because it seems to be limited at 2 Mbps. Custom server access URLs \u00b6 A comma-separated list of URLs (either HTTP or HTTPS), which will be published to plex.tv for server discovery. This can be very useful in a few cases: if you\u2019re using a reverse proxy in front of the media server, or if your networking configuration is otherwise unique. For instance, if you have your own custom domain with subdomain. Suggested: Depending on your setup Example: https://plex.mycustomdomain.com:32400 Webhooks \u00b6 This feature can be enabled to allow your server to send events to external services. For example Notifiarr Transcoders \u00b6 Transcoder quality \u00b6 This will influence the quality used when transcoding media. Suggested: Automatic Most users should leave it set to Automatic. Hardware-Accelerated Streaming is not affected by this setting. Transcoder temporary directory \u00b6 Directory to use when transcoding temporary files for streaming. Suggested: Depending on your setup, if possible, your RAM (disk) Speeds up transcoding and less I/O, transcode data is temporary and doesn't need to be writing to a disk. If you run docker set this to /transcode and map it to /tmp/plex Default Linux only allocates a max of 50% of total system RAM to any ram directories (ie. /tmp, /dev/shm, etc.) WARNING YOU SHOULD NOT SPECIFY A LOCATION THAT RESIDES ON A NETWORK SHARE/DISK. Enable HDR tone mapping \u00b6 This feature allows Plex Media Server to maintain high visual fidelity of content, by applying tone mapping to convert it to SDR when transcoding HDR content. Suggested: Depending on your setup Most HDR content will be in 4K resolution. If your platform has to use software transcoding to perform the tone mapping, then it may well struggle convert 4K content in real-time, unless you\u2019re running on a very powerful system. Note Plex\u2019s tone mapping support should generally be able to produce good color mapping and help avoid the \u201cwashed out\u201d colors that occur when converting HDR content without tone mapping. Use hardware acceleration when available \u00b6 To use Hardware-Accelerated Streaming in Plex Media Server. Suggested: Enabled Use hardware-accelerated video encoding \u00b6 To use Hardware-Accelerated Encoding in Plex Media Server. Suggested: Enabled Manage \u00b6 Libraries \u00b6 Here you will find your libraries you've added to your Plex Media Server. Examples - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Movies (/data/media/movies) Movies-4K/Movies-UHD (/data/media/movies4k) / (/data/media/movies-uhd) Movies-Kids (/data/media/movies-kids) Movies-Anime (/data/media/movies-anime) TV (/data/media/tv) TV-4k/TV-UHD (/data/media/tv-4k) / (/data/media/tv-uhd) TV-Kids (/data/media/tv-kids) TV-Anime (/data/media/tv-anime) Anime (/data/media/anime) etc I will only cover the libraries settings for Movies and TV shows Movies \u00b6 The new version of the Plex Movie agent/scanner Suggested: Plex Movie Besides being much faster at scanning and getting metadata, one of the benefits of the new agent is that all agent settings are set at the library level, so that different libraries using the same agent can have different agent settings. When scanning this library, use local posters and artwork if present. (Local subtitles files will be used whether this is enabled or not) Suggested: Enabled I had this enabled because I thought it was needed for local subtitles (.srt), but after research it seems it isn't needed. If you want you could disable it, the choice is yours. When scanning this library, prefer embedded tags and local files if present. Suggested: Disabled If enabled you could end up with weird movie naming you don't want, happens especially from releases from RARBG Automatically create collections when there are more than the selected number of items for an available collection. Suggested: 2 Only show collections when you have more than one item in your library This option creates a series of preview thumbnails from a media item when it is analyzed. These images are used by some Plex apps when you move back and forward in an app with the timeline scrubber. They\u2019ll also be displayed in Now Playing when someone is streaming from you so that you can see where they are in the video. ATTENTION Creating these images can take a considerable amount of time , CPU resources , and increase the storage space used . The images are stored in your Plex database so be careful you don\u2019t fill the drive Suggested: Disabled Besides that, it uses a lot of disk space and high I/O, No one in my family uses FastForward/Rewind but they use the skip forward/backward. This deletes the preview thumbnails it generated before you disabled this option If you want to show your Collection in your library Suggested: Disabled When Disabled your movies will show up normally when you use library view, This doesn't mean it will disable the collection view. TV \u00b6 The new version of the Plex Movie agent/scanner Suggested: Plex TV Series Besides being much faster at scanning and getting metadata, one of the benefits of the new agent is that all agent settings are set at the library level, so that different libraries using the same agent can have different agent settings. How episodes are named on disk. If your naming follows The MovieDB or TheTVDB choose that here. Use season titles when available. When scanning this library, use local posters and artwork if present. (Local subtitles files will be used whether this is enabled or not) Suggested: Enabled I had this enabled because I thought it was needed for local subtitles (.srt), but after research it seems it isn't needed.

Generate intro detection for items in this library when enabled in server settings. Suggested: Enabled Ever watch a TV show and it starts playing that same minute and a half credits intro that you've already watched multiple times? Well, you can have your Plex Media Server analyze the TV shows to try and detect those introductions and then let you skip through them with a single click!

These have been collected from either discussions on discord or that I created with help from others. Special thanks to rg9400 , bakerboy448 and Team Radarr. With Radarr V3, Custom Formats are much more advanced/powerful than with v0.2, although this also means a Custom Format is much more complicated to setup. After requesting at Team Radarr we now have the options to import/export the Custom Formats in a JSON format that we can use here what makes it easier to share the different kind of Custom Formats. I also made 3 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to upgrade Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to upgrade your existing the Custom Formats. How to setup Custom Formats Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format.

On HDR10 displays that have lower color volume than the HDR10 content (e.g. lower peak brightness capability), the HDR10 metadata provides information to help the display adjust to the video. The metadata, however, is static and constant with respect to each individual video and doesn't inform the display exactly how the content should be adjusted. The interaction between display capabilities, video metadata, and the ultimate output (i.e. the presentation of the video) is mediated by the display, with the result that the original producer's intent may not be preserved.

HDR capture and displays are capable of brighter whites and deeper blacks. To accommodate this, HDR encoding standards allow for a higher maximum luminance and use at least a 10-bit dynamic range (color depth, compared to 8-bit for non-professional and 10-bit for professional SDR video) in order to maintain precision across this extended range.

Both are just names to describe the best possible currently for the movie. To be clear, the final digital films on the Mastered in 4K Blu-rays still only have the same 1920 x 1080 pixels of actual resolution as normal Blu-rays. But the argument goes that because these full HD files were derived from higher-resolution masters, their images will be more precise, with better colours, less noise, and enhanced sharpness and detail. Not least because the higher-resolution mastering process will provide more detail from the original print for the Blu-ray masters to draw on when going through their (hopefully\u2026) frame-by-frame compression process. Another important element of the Mastered in 4K discs is that they\u2019re all mastered with \u2018x.v.YCC\u2019 colour specification.

With Radarr V3, Custom Formats are much more advanced/powerful than with v0.2, although this also means a Custom Format is much more complicated to setup. After requesting at Team Radarr we now have the options to import/export the Custom Formats in a JSON format that we can use here what makes it easier to share the different kind of Custom Formats. I also made 3 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to upgrade Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to upgrade your existing the Custom Formats. How to setup Custom Formats Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Formats preferences will be used and not ignored. Questions or Suggestions?

It is the most widespread of the HDR formats. It is not backward compatible with SDR displays. It is technically limited to a maximum of 10,000 nits peak brightness; however, HDR10 content is commonly mastered with a peak brightness between 1000 and 4000 nits. HDR10 lacks dynamic metadata. On HDR10 displays that have lower color volume than the HDR10 content (e.g. lower peak brightness capability), the HDR10 metadata provides information to help the display adjust to the video. The metadata, however, is static and constant with respect to each individual video and doesn't inform the display exactly how the content should be adjusted. The interaction between display capabilities, video metadata, and the ultimate output (i.e. the presentation of the video) is mediated by the display, with the result that the original producer's intent may not be preserved.

But the argument goes that because these full HD files were derived from higher-resolution masters, their images will be more precise, with better colours, less noise, and enhanced sharpness and detail. Not least because the higher-resolution mastering process will provide more detail from the original print for the Blu-ray masters to draw on when going through their (hopefully\u2026) frame-by-frame compression process.

There isn't a best scores setup, being that everyone has its own personal preference what they prefer Audio or Video or perhaps both. But being I still get a lot of questions about it I decided to create a Guide for it. Here I will try to explain with some personal used examples how to make the most use of Custom Formats. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours. Important I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr !!! Instructions can be found HERE Basics \u00b6 Note Custom formats are implemented within and have their impact controlled by Quality Profiles. The Upgrade Until score prevents upgrading once a release with this desired score has been downloaded. A score of 0 results in the custom format being informational only. The Minimum score requires releases to reach this threshold otherwise they will be rejected. Custom formats that match with undesirable attributes should be given a negative score to lower their appeal. Outright rejections should be given a negative score low enough that even if all of the other formats with positive scores were added, the score would still fall below the minimum. First the basics where we going to explain where to setup the Custom Formats after you've added them, what we've explained in How to import Custom Formats . And a short description what the settings means. Settings => Profiles Then select the profile that you use/prefer. Radarr Custom Format can be set per profile and isn't global Profile name. If you want that Radarr will upgrade till the quality set in (3.). Upgrade till the selected Quality. The Minimum Custom Format Score allowed to download. More Info Keep upgrading Custom Format till this score is reached. (setting this to 0 means no upgrades will happen based on Custom Formats) Your preferred language profile for your Releases. In your chosen profile at the bottom you will see the added Custom Profiles where you can start setting up the scores. Overall tips and suggestions \u00b6 Attention Keep in mind Custom Formats are made to fine tune your Quality Profile Generally Quality Trumps All The current logic can be found HERE As of 1/19/2021 the logic is as follows Quality Custom Format Score Protocol Indexer Priority Indexer Flags Peers (If Torrent) Age (If Usenet) Size My suggestion is to create tiers of scores based on what things matter to you. Personally I would only add the Custom Formats that do what you actually prefer especially in the beginning, including the Releases you should avoid Examples \u00b6 Here I will show how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. That you can use to get a idea how to setup yours. All these examples make use of the Collection of Custom Formats Which overall scoring scheme do you use ? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Which overall scoring scheme do you use \u00b6 Advanced Audio 2000 for the highest with steps of 100 down. HDR Metadata 1000 for the highest with steps of 100 down (except for Dovi SL). Movie Versions 200 for the highest with steps of 10 down. Misc Variable depending on your use case. Releases you should avoid -10000 If you notice that some scores are missing between the different Quality Profiles examples it's because I decided to be consistent with the scoring. Meaning a certain Custom Format has in every used Quality Profile the same score. Releases you should avoid \u00b6 In my opinion this is a must for every Quality Profile you use, all these Custom Formats make sure you don't get Low Quality Releases. Info Add all of the following Custom Formats as -10000 Breakdown and Why - [CLICK TO EXPAND] BR-DISK This is a custom format to help Radarr recognize & ignore BR-DISK (ISO's and Blu-ray folder structure) in addition to the standard BR-DISK quality. EVO except WEB-DL This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. Low Quality Releases A collection of known Low Quality groups that are often banned from the the top trackers because the lack of quality or other reasons. 720/1080p no x265 This blocks/ignores 720/1080p releases that are encoded in x265 - More info HERE . 3D Is 3D still a thing for home use ? No-RlsGroup Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match DoVi (WEBDL) This is a special Custom Format that ignores DV for WEB-DL but together with the normal DoVi allows for other sources. WEB-DL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR(10), What can results in weird playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not DoVi compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR(10). example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Tip You might even can consider to add Multi if you want to make sure you don't grab releases with often foreign audio. Prefer Advanced Audio \u00b6 Lets say you prefer HD audio (with object metadata) Then we would use the following order. Basic Dolby Digital (DD) < AAC < Basic DTS (DTS) < DTS-ES < Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) < DTS-HD HRA < PCM = FLAC < DTS-HD MA < TrueHD < DD+ ATMOS = ATMOS (undefined) < DTS X < TrueHD ATMOS In this example above I have lossy Atmos over lossless DTS because the object metadata matters more to me over lossy vs lossless example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Prefer HDR Metadata \u00b6 Lets say you prefer HDR metadata Then we would use the following order. HDR (undefined) = HDR < Dolby Vision I didn't add Dolby Vision (Single Layer) being most of the releases are already replaced by real Dolby Vision releases, If you still want to add it put it between HDR and Dolby Vision so they still can get upgraded. Also I didn't add 10 Bit being 4k releases are 99% 10bit anyway. example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Prefer HQ Encodes \u00b6 If you prefer HQ Encodes (Bluray-720/1080/2160p) I suggest to first follow the Quality Settings (File Size) If you think the sizes are to big to your preference then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you. For this Quality Profile we're going to make use of Movie Versions , Misc (-10000) and Misc Make sure you add the Releases you should avoid I decided not to add Audio Advanced Custom Formats to the encodes profile being with encodes I prefer higher video quality, If I want also the HD audio formats I would go for the Remuxes. The Custom Formats we're going to use and scoring. And you use the following main settings in your profile. Info Make sure you don't check the BR-DISK, The reason why I didn't select the WEB-DL 720p is because you will find hardly any releases that aren't done as 1080p WEB-DL The following workflow will be applied: It will download WEB-DL 1080p for the streaming movies you see more often lately. It will upgrade till Bluray-1080p when available. The downloaded media will be upgraded to any of the added Custom Formats till a score of 9999. So why such a ridiculous high Upgrade Until Custom and not a score of 100 ? Because I'm to lazy to calculate the maximum for every of my used Quality Profile and I want it to upgrade to the highest as possible anyway. Info If you prefer 2160/4K encodes you might consider to enable HDR and set the Upgrade Until Quality to Bluray-2160p Remux-1080p \u00b6 If you prefer 1080p Remuxes (Remux-1080p) I suggest to first follow the Quality Settings (File Size) If you think the sizes are to big to your preference then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you.

FAQ and Tips \u00b6 Proper and Repacks \u00b6 Proper and Repacks - [CLICK TO EXPAND] I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Formats preferences will be used and not ignored. Custom Formats to avoid certain releases \u00b6 How to use a Custom Formats to avoid certain releases? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] For Custom Formats you really want to avoid, set it to something really low like -10000 and not something like -10 . Being when you add a Custom Format what you prefer and you set it to something like +10 it could happen that for example the BR-DISK will be downloaded (-10)+(+10)=0 and if your Minimum Custom Format Score is set at 0 . Custom Formats with a score of 0 \u00b6 What do Custom Formats with a score of 0 do? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] All Custom Formats with a score of 0 are pure informational and don't do anything. Minimum Custom Format Score \u00b6 Minimum Custom Format Score - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Some people suggest not to use minus score for your Custom Formats and set this option to a higher score then 0. The reason why I don't prefer/use this is because you could limit your self when some new groups or what ever will be released. Also it makes it much more clear what you prefer and what you want to avoid. Audio Channels \u00b6 Audio Channels - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Personally I wouldn't add the audio channels Custom Formats being you could limit your self in the amount of releases you're able to get. Only use this if you got specific reasons that you need them. Using it with any kind of Remuxes Quality Profile is useless in my opinion being that 99% of all remuxes are multi audio anyway. and you can better score using the Audio Advanced Custom Formats Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format \u00b6 Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format - [CLICK TO EXPAND] If possible avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format with a score, it's smarter to use the 720/1080p no x265 Custom Format. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Use x265 only for 4k releases and the 720/1080p no x265 makes sure you still can get the x265 releases.

Being that release profiles are global without the use of a tag. Dual-Audio Regex \u00b6 Having tested most of these settings, they work pretty well but Anime is a fickle beast to toy with so be warned. Anime Delete \u00b6 If you have issues with extra files being download like NCED or NCOP If you have issues with sonarr picking up a bunch of: NCED NCOP Music Videos OP's Then this script (linux based only) will delete these files and get rid of them and you don't have to worry about them cluttering up your Auto or Manual import process. #!/usr/bin/env bash # Set the following location to your completed download location for Anime. # Usually one of the following paths: # Dockers => /data/{usenet|torrents}/anime # Cloudbox => /mnt/local/downloads/nzbs/nzbget/completed/sonarranime location = \"/your/download/path/here\" find $location -type f \\( -iname \"*op[0-9]*\" -o -iname \"*nced*\" -o -iname \"*ncop*\" -o -iname \"*music video*\" \\) -exec rm -rf {} \\; This script will be called through a custom connection in sonarr. Copy the contents of the script into whatever filepath sonarr has access to ( /config/app/ or /appdata/sonarr/scripts ) Edit the location=\"/your/download/path/here\" and make sure it's in quotes. Then save it and chmod +x the script. In Sonarr go to Settings => Connect => Click on the + Symbol => and select Custom Script Change Name to whatever you like. Select On Grab and On Import . Click the Folder icon or type in the path to the script you chose earlier. Now when you download or import any files the script will run and clear out those files that you most likely won't use and if you want them well this script isn't for you. Media Management \u00b6 Note There a few settings which make life a lot easier when tracking down and keeping certain information for your Anime and with tweaks to make it work better with HamaAgent for plex. Suggested naming scheme \u00b6 For this I used the Sonarr Recommended naming scheme for Sonarr with only a small change for a formatting error to be fixed and the Series Folder Format for easier matching. Anime Episode Format \u00b6 Has all necessary information and a little extra if you needed to rebuild. { Series TitleYear } - S { season:00 } E { episode:00 } - { absolute:000 } - { Episode CleanTitle } [{ Preferred Words }{ Quality Full }]{[ MediaInfo VideoDynamicRange ]}[{ MediaInfo VideoBitDepth } bit ]{[ MediaInfo VideoCodec ]}[{ Mediainfo AudioCodec } { Mediainfo AudioChannels }]{ MediaInfo AudioLanguages }{ -Release Group } RESULTS: Single Episode: The Series Title!

Indexers \u00b6 We need to add the Anime Categories to our indexers otherwise this all won't work very well. Example We need to open Settings -> Indexers Select the Indexer(s) you would like to use for Anime Select the dropdown for Anime Categories . Select the Anime category. Click outside the pop-up modal but inside the Add Indexer modal. Note Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming where applicable and add {Preferred Words} to your renaming scheme else you could get a download loop issues!!! Release Profiles \u00b6 Note We're going to make use of 2 separate release profiles. First Release Profile \u00b6 Important DO Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming on this release profile. Multi-Audio \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred with a score of [500] / ( multi [ ._- ] ?audio ) /i Dual-Audio \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred with a score of [0] . This is for renames only and why it is at 0 . It is also added in the second profile. This one is to ensure that the preferred words get added. / ( dual [ ._- ] ?audio ) /i Optional (uncut|unrated|uncensored) \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred with a score of [100]/[-10000] If you would like it to be priority then set to 100 . If you do not want uncensored set it to -10000 . If you don't care either way just leave it out. The reasoning behind only 100 is so that it doesn't trump other release further up in the chain, this way it will trump maybe a couple release but not more. And -10000 to hopefully put it at the bottom of any tier list if you don't want it. / ( uncut | unrated | uncensored | \\b ( AT [ -_. ] ?X ) \\b ) /i Note When done it should look something like this: Second Release Profile \u00b6 Warning DO NOT Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming Must Not Contain \u00b6 The reason most of these are added is due to their shitty quality or just in general are not as good as other stuff that is out there. This can be tweaked as needed. Let me know if you run into any issues here. You should be able to just copy paste these in one go. If there is a reason something shouldn't be here let me know and your logic and I will be open to adjusting. Important If you would like dub releases then remove the last 2 lines and do not add them. / ( \\[ EMBER \\] | -EMBER \\b | DaddySubs ) /i, / ( BDMV | M2TS | \\b SSA \\b | \\b VOSTFR \\b | \\b AbemaTV \\b ) /i, / ( CuaP | PnPSubs | ICEBLUE | SLAX | U3-Web ) /i, / ( Raws-Maji | \\b KRP \\b | M@nI | Kanjouteki | PuyaSubs ) /i, / \\b ( Beatrice | ohys | Kawaiika | neko | daddy )[ ._- ] ?

With this option you can fine tune your preference. The Release profile that we're going to use for this example is mainly to prefer P2P releases over Scene releases, (Scene releases are still being downloaded but upgraded). If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you. FAQ - [CLICK TO EXPAND] FAQ \u00b6 Q: Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL? A: I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between Quality and Size and you often don't see big difference anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc) Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene releases? A: Scene release always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible. So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also I noticed that with some Scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio. And in my opinion the P2P are of better quality. There's one scene group that does bring out quality releases -deflate/-inflate . Q: Why do I see that many Amazon WEB-DL's repacks/proper lately? A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated the episodes will be REPACKED. Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups? A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile, I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why ? Lately I noticed a lot of popup scene releases meaning we need to update often. With this it also means all scene and (yet) unknown groups will be getting a score of 0 and not -50 . I will still keep a eye on them and add the Low Quality Groups to the -100 score and when I find a new P2P group I will add them, resulting in less updates and a more accurate upgrade. Propers and Repacks \u00b6 First we're need to make sure a P2P release isn't being replaced by a Scene Repack/Proper release ! Settings => Media Management Where we going to set it to Do not Prefer Then we navigate in Sonarr to the Settings => Profiles Then you will get a popup screen that will look like this: Must Contain => add words that the release name MUST HAVE! Must Not Contain => add words that the release name MUST NOT HAVE OR IT WILL BE REJECTED! Preferred => add words you prefer with a certain score what you prefer more or upgrade. Include Preferred when Renaming => When you add {Preferred Words} to your renaming scheme it will add this info. Indexers => Specify what indexer the profile applies to. Tags => create a tag so this is only used by shows that you give this tag or else it's global. Note The Number between the [ brackets ] in the following release profiles are the scores the release name will get during a automatic and manual search and with the use of the scores some releases will be preferred over others and even upgraded. First Release Profile \u00b6 Important We're going to make use of 2 separate release profiles. Release Sources (Streaming Service) \u00b6 Note Also check mark Include Preferred when Renaming and add {Preferred Words} to your renaming scheme when you get download loop issues!!! What it does: When enabled the block with the Release Source (Streaming Service) in it are then added to the file name which fixes any loops due to Sonarr seeing a new NF rip when an AMZN rip is found. Probably doesn\u2019t happen if cutoff is met, but for anything that is unmet or any forced searches it results in a loop because NF is not in Sonarr\u2019s copy so it upgrades, and loops. Enabling the include in preferred words for AMZN and adding that to the file name fixes that.

Second Release Profile \u00b6 Warning DO NOT Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming Golden rule \u00b6 Add this to your Must not contain (2) / ( ? =( 1080 | 720 )) .* (( x | h )[ ._- ] ?265 | hevc ) /i example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Why the Must Not Contain entry - [CLICK TO EXPAND] So why did I put /(?=(1080|720)).*((x|h)[ ._-]?265|hevc)/i as Must Not Contain and what does it do ? It blocks/ignores 720/1080p releases that are encoded in x265, why ? Quote x265 is good for for 4k stuff or 1080p if they used the the remuxes as source. If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time. Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done. It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265. The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases. And the few groups that do use the correct source suffer from it. That's why I created my own golden rule. 720/1080p => x264 2160p/4k => x265 P2P Groups + Repack/Proper \u00b6 Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [180] The reason why this one get's such a high score is because it's the only quality scene group that exist (till now) and scene groups don't add the Release Sources (Streaming Service) to their release name so they don't get the extra point of the release source regex. / ( -deflate | -inflate ) \\b /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [150] / ( -AJP69 | -BTN | -CasStudio | -CtrlHD | -KiNGS ) \\b /i / ( -monkee | -NTb | -NTG | -QOQ | -RTN ) \\b /i / ( -TOMMY | -ViSUM | -T6D ) \\b /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [125] / ( -BTW | -Chotab | -CiT | -DEEP | -iJP | -iT00NZ ) \\b /i / ( -LAZY | -NYH | -SA89 | -SIGMA | -TEPES | -TVSmash ) \\b /i / ( -SDCC | -iKA | -iJP | -Cinefeel | -SPiRiT | -FC ) \\b /i / ( -JETIX | -Coo7 | -WELP | -KiMCHI | -BLUTONiUM ) \\b /i / ( -orbitron | -ETHiCS | -RTFM | -PSiG | -MZABI ) \\b /i / ( -ROCCaT | 3cTWeB | playWEB | -FLUX | NOSiViD ) \\b /i / ( -KHN | NPMS | -END ) \\b /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [100] / ( -ViSiON ) \\b /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [12] / ( repack3 ) /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [11] / ( repack2 ) /i Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [10] / \\b ( repack | proper ) \\b /i example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Attention These screenshots are just examples to show you how it should look and where you need to place the data that you need to add, they aren't a 100% reflection of the actual data and not always 100% up to date with the actual data you need to add.

With this option you can fine tune your preference. The Release profile that we're going to use for this example is mainly to prefer P2P releases over Scene releases, (Scene releases are still being downloaded but upgraded). If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you. FAQ - [CLICK TO EXPAND]","title":"Release Profile RegEx (WEB-DL)"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/#faq","text":"Q: Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL? A: I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between Quality and Size and you often don't see big difference anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc) Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene releases? A: Scene release always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible. So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also I noticed that with some Scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio. And in my opinion the P2P are of better quality. There's one scene group that does bring out quality releases -deflate/-inflate . Q: Why do I see that many Amazon WEB-DL's repacks/proper lately? A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated the episodes will be REPACKED. Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups? A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile, I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why ? Lately I noticed a lot of popup scene releases meaning we need to update often. With this it also means all scene and (yet) unknown groups will be getting a score of 0 and not -50 .
