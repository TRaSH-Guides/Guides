So I decided to fine tune it to try to get the releases &amp; quality I preferred. On Discord, I also noticed that others run in to the same issue so I explained them how I managed to get it solved. Being that I had to explain it often, I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link it to someone when they needed it. After a while I also decided to create guides for frequently asked questions, and started to collect all kind of information gathered from various sources. I try to make my guides as easy as possible for everyone to understand, in my opinion pictures explain often more than just some text.</p>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>If you have questions, suggestions, requests or want to contribute, click the chat badge to join the Discord Channel where you can ask your questions directly or use the following link to open an issue on GitHub.

This does not cover jails or other virtualization means on the TrueNAS Core platform.</p> <p>This guide assumes that you've already created a pool, which by default will contain a top-level dataset that was configured during the time of pool configuration. For the examples below, we'll be using a pool name of <code>tank</code>. Encryption is recommended on the pool (TrueNAS uses ZFS Encryption with AES-256-GCM in TrueNAS Core 13), but not required. TrueNAS Core allows for granularity in encrypting individual datasets if you don't want to encrypt at the top-level dataset and have it be inherited down to the other datasets.</p> <p>TrueNAS Core defaults to <code>lz4</code> encryption as the compression level when creating a pool. This is fine for most workloads, and can be safely inherited down to other datasets under the top-level dataset. <code>ztsd</code> is currently the default in FreeBSD, however TrueNAS Core still defaults to <code>lz4</code>. Given that media files are not very compressible by nature, the only benefit that compression provides in this case is to supplementary files such as <code>.srt</code>, <code>.nfo</code>, etc.</p> <p>Additionally, since SMB does not support hardlinks we will only be covering the creation and use of NFS shares.</p>"},{"location":"Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/TrueNAS-Core/#create-the-main-dataset","title":"Create the main dataset","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>To get hardlinks and atomic moves working with ZFS you will need to make use of ONE dataset with subfolders.

It is the most widespread of the HDR formats. It is not backward compatible with SDR displays. It is technically limited to a maximum of 10,000 nits peak brightness; however, HDR10 content is commonly mastered with a peak brightness between 1000 and 4000 nits.</p> <p>HDR10 lacks dynamic metadata. On HDR10 displays that have lower color volume than the HDR10 content (e.g. lower peak brightness capability), the HDR10 metadata provides information to help the display adjust to the video. The metadata, however, is static and constant with respect to each individual video and doesn't inform the display exactly how the content should be adjusted. The interaction between display capabilities, video metadata, and the ultimate output (i.e. the presentation of the video) is mediated by the display, with the result that the original producer's intent may not be preserved.</p> JSON - [Click to show/hide] <pre><code>{\n  \"trash_id\": \"dfb86d5941bc9075d6af23b09c2aeecd\",\n  \"trash_scores\": {\n    \"default\": 500\n  },\n  \"name\": \"HDR10\",\n  \"includeCustomFormatWhenRenaming\": false,\n  \"specifications\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"HDR10\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": false,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\bHDR10(\\\\b[^+|Plus])\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not DV HDR10\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"^(?=.*\\\\b(DV|DoVi|Dolby[ .]?V(ision)?)\\\\b)(?=.*\\\\b(HDR(10)?(P(lus)?)?)\\\\b)\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not PQ\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\b(PQ)\\\\b\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not HLG\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\b(HLG)\\\\b\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not SDR\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\bSDR(\\\\b|\\\\d)\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not DV\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\b(dv|dovi|dolby[ .]?v(ision)?)\\\\b\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p><sub><sup>TOP</sup>"},{"location":"Radarr/Radarr-collection-of-custom-formats/#hdr","title":"HDR","text":"<p><sub>HDR</sub></p> HDR - [Click to show/hide] <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p> <p>High-dynamic-range video (HDR video) is video having a dynamic range greater than that of standard-dynamic-range video (SDR video).HDR video involves capture, production, content/encoding, and display.

[Click to show/hide] <p>Why am I getting purple or green colors?</p> <p>There are several possible reasons why your TV would show purple or green colors when playing Dolby Vision content.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Unsupported Hardware: Your TV or hardware media player device (Roku, AppleTV, etc) doesn't support Dolby Vision or your hardware media player device doesn't support all the Dolby Vision Profiles. As a result, the device might struggle to produce accurate colors, leading to a purple or green tint.</p> </li> <li> <p>Incorrect Display Settings: Dolby Vision content often requires specific settings to be enabled on your TV or display device in order to deliver the intended visual experience. If these settings are not configured properly, it can result in the device showing distorted colors (including purple or green hues).</p> </li> <li> <p>HDMI Compatibility Issues: Sometimes, HDMI cables or ports may not be fully compatible with Dolby Vision. If the media player device is not recognizing the Dolby Vision signal properly, it may fail to process the content correctly, resulting in abnormal color rendering.</p> </li> </ol> <p>To resolve the purple or green color issues when playing Dolby Vision content, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:</p> <ol> <li>Ensure your TV or hardware media player device is Dolby Vision compatible and up-to-date with the latest firmware.</li> <li>Verify that your TV or display device is set up correctly and has the necessary Dolby Vision settings enabled.</li> <li>Check the HDMI cables and ensure they are capable of transmitting Dolby Vision signals.</li> </ol> Dolby Vision Profiles - [Click to show/hide] <p>Dolby Vision Profiles</p> <ul> <li>Profile 5 <sup>(1)</sup> - This is what comes with WEB-DL Dolby Vision releases without HDR10 fallback.(Incompatible devices will playback with blown out pinks and greens)</li> <li>Profile 7 <sup>(2)</sup> - This is what comes with UHD Bluray Remuxes and UHD BluRay releases.These files will play on an Nvidia Shield Pro (2019), but on most other players will revert to the HDR10 fallback.</li> <li>Profile 8 <sup>(3)</sup> - This is what comes with (Hybrid) WEB-DL (HULU), Hybrid UHD Remux, and UHD BluRay releases (all of which have HDR10 fallback).This works with several mainstream media players.</li> </ul> <p>Plex for Apple TV and Plex with Infuse is only capable of playing Dolby Vision profiles 5 and 8 correctly if CMv2.9 is being used.This is something that cannot be determined beforehand.So whether you are using an Apple TV, with or without Infuse, it will always be hit or miss whether the content is compatible.Additionally, it is uncertain whether the Dolby Vision layer will play, fall back to HDR10, or encounter a black screen.</p> <ul> <li><sup>(1) PLEX for AppleTV and Plex with Infuse will only play profile 5 correctly if CMv2.9 is used</sup></li> <li><sup>(2) Neither Infuse nor PLEX for AppleTV will deliver real Dolby Vision with Profile 7.</sup></li> <li><sup>(3) On PLEX for AppleTV it won't deliver real Dolby Vision with Profile 8, and will only play the HDR10 fallback if CM2.9 is used, otherwise you will end up with a black screen\u201calthough your TV will incorrectly say that it is playing DV\u201d.With infuse it will convert it on the fly to Profile 5, and deliver real Dolby Vision if CMv2.9 is used, otherwise you will end up with a black screen\u201cMake sure you set the Extended Dolby Vision settings to Limited (prefer accuracy), Convert P8 to P5 (when possible), and play other P8 as HDR (output will switch to either DoVi or HDR depending on the video)\u201d</sup></li> </ul> Dolby Vision Versions - CMv2.9 and CMv4.0 - [Click to show/hide] <p>It is too technical to explain in detail, so I'll keep it short with tested facts: PLEX for AppleTV and Plex with Infuse only support CMv2.9.</p> <p>There are two versions of Dolby Vision, namely CMv2.9 and CMv4.0.

(Scene releases are still being downloaded, but replaced once an upgrade is found.)</p> <p>If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you.</p> FAQ - [Click to show/hide]"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/#faq","title":"FAQ","text":"<p>Q: Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL?</p> <p>A: I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between quality and size and you often don't see big differences anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc)</p> <p>Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene groups?</p> <p>A: Scene groups always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible.</p> <p>So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also, I noticed that with some scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio.</p> <p>In my opinion the P2P releases are of better quality. There's one scene group that does bring out quality releases <code>-deflate/-inflate</code>.</p> <p>Q: Why do I see so many repacks/propers of Amazon WEB-DLs lately?</p> <p>A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated, the episodes will be REPACKED.</p> <p>Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups?</p> <p>A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile. I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why?

It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality.</p> <p>Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities.</p> <p>So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265. The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people</p> <p>It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases.

It is the most widespread of the HDR formats. It is not backward compatible with SDR displays. It is technically limited to a maximum of 10,000 nits peak brightness; however, HDR10 content is commonly mastered with a peak brightness between 1000 and 4000 nits.</p> <p>HDR10 lacks dynamic metadata. On HDR10 displays that have lower color volume than the HDR10 content (e.g. lower peak brightness capability), the HDR10 metadata provides information to help the display adjust to the video. The metadata, however, is static and constant with respect to each individual video and doesn't inform the display exactly how the content should be adjusted. The interaction between display capabilities, video metadata, and the ultimate output (i.e. the presentation of the video) is mediated by the display, with the result that the original producer's intent may not be preserved.</p> JSON - [Click to show/hide] <pre><code>{\n  \"trash_id\": \"3497799d29a085e2ac2df9d468413c94\",\n  \"trash_scores\": {\n    \"default\": 500\n  },\n  \"name\": \"HDR10\",\n  \"includeCustomFormatWhenRenaming\": false,\n  \"specifications\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"HDR10\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": false,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\bHDR10(\\\\b[^+|Plus])\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not DV HDR10\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"^(?=.*\\\\b(DV|DoVi|Dolby[ .]?V(ision)?)\\\\b)(?=.*\\\\b(HDR(10)?(P(lus)?)?)\\\\b)\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not PQ\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\b(PQ)\\\\b\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not HLG\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\b(HLG)\\\\b\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not SDR\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\bSDR(\\\\b|\\\\d)\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Not DV\",\n      \"implementation\": \"ReleaseTitleSpecification\",\n      \"negate\": true,\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"fields\": {\n        \"value\": \"\\\\b(dv|dovi|dolby[ .]?v(ision)?)\\\\b\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p><sub><sup>TOP</sup>"},{"location":"Sonarr/sonarr-collection-of-custom-formats/#hdr","title":"HDR","text":"<p><sub>HDR</sub></p> HDR - [Click to show/hide] <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p> <p>High-dynamic-range video (HDR video) is video having a dynamic range greater than that of standard-dynamic-range video (SDR video).HDR video involves capture, production, content/encoding, and display.
