Here you will find guides mainly for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr and everything related to it. How this all started When I started using Sonarr/Radarr, I noticed that it didn't grab the releases that I actually wanted, as I'm a bit picky about which releases and what quality I prefer. So I decided to fine tune it to try to get the releases & quality I preferred. On Discord, I also noticed that others run in to the same issue so I explained them how I managed to get it solved. Being that I had to explain it often, I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link it to someone when they needed it. After a while I also decided to create guides for frequently asked questions, and started to collect all kind of information gathered from various sources. I try to make my guides as easy as possible for everyone to understand, in my opinion pictures explain often more than just some text. Support If you have questions, suggestions, requests or want to contribute, click the chat badge to join the Discord Channel where you can ask your questions directly or use the following link to open an issue on GitHub. Feel free to create a PR if you want to. DISCLAIMER The information I use for the guides is information I have gathered from different sources like support forums, Reddit or Discord, provided by user input or from the development teams. I have tested most things myself and I have tried to see if I could tune them a bit more to my needs and sometimes even for others. You use everything here at your own risk. I won't be responsible if something happens to your setup or collection! Special Thanks iXNyNe aka nemchik for introducing me in the world of dockers with DockSTARTer, and helping me to learn the basics for it. Roxedus for helping me with the transfer/conversion of my Github guides to MkDocs and make everything look great. rg9400 for the providing most of the Radarr v3 Custom Format Collection.

Settings => Sonarr Use Sonarr Click on Enabled Enable Sonarr. Enter the hostname or the IP address of the computer running your Sonarr instance. Info Be aware that when using Bazarr in docker, you cannot reach another container on the same Docker host using the loopback address (ex.: 127.0.0.1 or localhost). Loopback address refers to the Bazarr Docker container, not the Docker host. Enter the TCP port of your Sonarr instance. Default is 8989. Sonarr uses the Base URL ONLY if used with a \"Reverse Proxy\" (ex: Nginx Proxy Manager or SWAG) and MUST have a leading slash if it is needed (ex: /sonarr).

Info Not needed if you reach it with a local IP address. Click the Test button after filling in all the fields. Make sure the test is successful before you proceed. Options Select the minimum score (in percentage) required for a subtitle file to be downloaded. Info Are your subs often out of sync or just bad? Raise the score! Episodes from series with those tags (case sensitive) in Sonarr will be excluded from automatic downloading of subtitles. In Sonarr you add a custom tag to a show, in this case the shows with these tags will be ignored by Bazarr. Episodes from series with these types in Sonarr will be excluded from automatic downloading of subtitles. Options: Standard , Anime , Daily Automatic downloading of subtitles will only happen for monitored shows/episodes in Sonarr. Path Mappings Note You should only use this section if Sonarr and Bazarr use a different path to access the same files.

Click on Add and you will get an extra option Here you enter the path that Sonarr uses to access your shows. Here you enter the path that Bazarr uses to access your shows. Attention IF YOU GOT THE SAME VALUES ON BOTH SIDES THEN YOU DON'T NEED IT!!! IT SHOULD ALSO BE REMOVED OR ELSE YOU WILL GET AN ERROR.

More info HERE The default path setup suggested by some docker developers that encourages people to use mounts like /movies , /tv and /downloads is very suboptimal and it makes them look like two or three file systems, even if they aren\u2019t ( Because of how Docker\u2019s volumes work ). It is the easiest way to get started. While easy to use, it has a major drawback. Mainly losing the ability to hardlink or instant move, resulting in a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used. But you're able to change this, by not using the pre-defined/recommended paths like: /downloads => /data/downloads , /data/usenet , /data/torrents /movies => /data/media/movies /tv => /data/media/tv Note Settings that aren't covered means you can change them to your own liking or just leave them on default. Downloads Tools => Options => Downloads (Or click on the cogwheel to access the options) When adding a torrent For consistency with other torrents I recommend leaving this on Original . Suggested: Original Delete the .torrent file after it has been added to qBittorrent. Suggested: Personal preference Pre-allocated disk space for the added torrents, this limits fragmentation and also makes sure if you use a cache drive or a feeder disk that the space is available. Suggested: Enabled Warning Do not set Pre-allocated disk space if you are using ZFS as your filesystem as ZFS does not support fallocate Saving Management Make sure this is set to Automatic . Your downloads will not go into the category folder otherwise. Suggested: Automatic This helps you to manage your file location based on categories. Suggested: Enabled Same as Step 2 Suggested: Enabled Your download root path (Download folder/location). Read the ATTENTION block below If you enable this, your incomplete downloads will be placed in this directory until completed. This could be useful if you want your downloads to use a separate SSD/Feeder disk 1 , but this also results in extra unnecessary moves or in worse cases a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete. Suggested: Personal preference ATTENTION ATTENTION You set your download location in your download client Your download client ONLY downloads to your download folder/location. And you tell Radarr where you want your clean media library Radarr imports from your download location (copy/move/hardlink) to your media folder/library Plex, Emby, JellyFin or Kodi should ONLY have access to your media folder/library Your Download and Media Library should be NEVER the same locations Connection Listening Port Set this to TCP for the best performance Suggested: TCP Your port used for incoming connections, this is the port you opened in your router/firewall or port forwarded at your VPN provider to make sure you're connectable. Suggested: The port you opened in your router/firewall or port forwarded at your VPN provider This should be disabled in your router for several security reasons. Suggested: Disabled Make sure this is disabled so you don't mess up the forwarded port. Suggested: Disabled Connections Limits The best settings for this depends on many factors so I won't be covering this. Suggested: personal preference based on your setup and connection. Proxy Server This is where you would add for example your SOCKS5 settings from your VPN provider. Suggested: I personally don't recommend this unsecure option being it's un-encrypted and only spoofs your IP. Speed Global Rate Limits Here you can set your global rate limits, meaning your maximum download/upload speed used by qBittorrent. (For all torrents) The best settings depends on many factors. Your ISP speed. Your hardware used. Bandwidth needed by other services in your home network. Suggested: For a home connection that you use with others it's best practice to set the upload/download rate to about 70-80% of your maximum upload/download speed. Alternative Rate Limits When enabled, it basically does the same as above, but with the option to setup a schedule. Examples: Limit your upload/download rate during daytime when you make most use of it, and unlimited it during nighttime when no one is using the connection. If you have an internet connection that's limited during specific hours (unlimited bandwidth during the night, but limited during the day) Suggested: Personal preference Rate Limits Settings Not going to cover the technical part of what it does, but the following settings are recommended for best speeds (in most cases). Prevents you from being flooded if the uTP protocol is used for any reason. Suggested: Enabled Apply rate limit to transport overhead Suggested: Disabled Apply rate limit to peers on LAN Suggested: Enabled Bittorrent Privacy These settings are mainly used for public trackers (and should be enabled for them) and not for private trackers, decent private trackers use a private flag where they ignore these settings. Suggested: Personal preference Recommended setting Allow encryption rather than enforcing it allows more peers to connect and is recommended on underpowered systems as it will allow for lower overhead. Suggested: Allow encryption Anonymous mode hides clients (qBittorrent) fingerprint from the peer-ID, sets the \u2018User-Agent\u2019 to Null and it doesn\u2019t share your IP-address directly with trackers (though peers will still see your IP address). If using private trackers, it's recommended to disable this. I also got reports from people who are using this that they had worse speeds. Suggested: Disabled Torrent Queueing These options allow you to control the number of active torrents being downloaded and uploaded. Suggested: personal preference based on your setup and connection. Seeding Limits Your maximum seeding ratio preference. (When both ratio and seeding time are enabled it will trigger the action on whatever happens first.) Suggested: Disabled Your maximum seeding time preference (When both ratio and seeding time are enabled it will trigger the action on whatever happens first.) Suggested: Disabled What to do when ratio or seeding time is reached. Suggested: Paused and Disabled Tip Personally, I recommend using the seeding goals in your Starr Apps indexer settings (enable advanced), or use qBit Manage Automatically add these trackers to new downloads Recommendation: Disabled Warning NEVER USE THIS OPTION ON (Semi-)PRIVATE TRACKERS Web UI Authentication When enabled there will be no authentication required for clients on localhost. When enabled there will be no authentication required for clients in the step.3 whitelist. Add all IP subnets that you want to bypass authentication. Security In some cases when this is enabled it could result in issues. Suggested: Disabled Questions or Suggestions?

Then Continue to How to setup for your installation method. FAQ What are Hardlinks What are hardlinks? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] [ Short answer ] Having a file in multiple locations without using double your storage space. [ Long answer ] Hard links are a way for a copy operation to be instant and not consume space for those additional copies. Every file is a hard link: some metadata that points at blocks on the file system, which is why they're restricted to the same file system . There can be as many metadata files pointing at those blocks as needed and the blocks know how many links point to them. Once the blocks have 0 links, they're considered deleted. This means: You can delete any \"copy\" w/o impacting the others. Your download client can remove it's \"copy\" w/o impacting the library \"copy\". The library \"copy\" can be removed by Plex or Sonarr/Radarr or yourself w/o impacting the download client \"copy\". Space is only regained when all \"copies\" are deleted. Modifying the file will impact all \"copies\". For example, modifying the id3 tags of a .mp3 download after import would modify the download client \"copy\", resulting in breaking the torrent.

[ Long answer ] Hard links are a way for a copy operation to be instant and not consume space for those additional copies. Every file is a hard link: some metadata that points at blocks on the file system, which is why they're restricted to the same file system . There can be as many metadata files pointing at those blocks as needed and the blocks know how many links point to them. Once the blocks have 0 links, they're considered deleted. This means: You can delete any \"copy\" w/o impacting the others. Your download client can remove it's \"copy\" w/o impacting the library \"copy\". The library \"copy\" can be removed by Plex or Sonarr/Radarr or yourself w/o impacting the download client \"copy\". Space is only regained when all \"copies\" are deleted. Modifying the file will impact all \"copies\". For example, modifying the id3 tags of a .mp3 download after import would modify the download client \"copy\", resulting in breaking the torrent.

I've also created a short guide HERE where I explain the settings for the most used applications. The main goal of DockSTARTer is to make it quick and easy to get up and running with Docker. You may choose to rely on DockSTARTer for various changes to your Docker system or use DockSTARTer as a stepping stone and learn to do more advanced configurations. DockSTARTer was actually my first steps in to the world of dockers. Note I'm not going to explain how to get dockers installed and running, I will only explain which folder structure we recommend. The paths mentioned below refer to internal paths for the containers! External paths depends where you mounted your share or your drives. For example /<path_to_data>/data , or even /data . Folder Structure Attention It doesn't really matter which path you use for your media and appdata, the only thing you should avoid is /home . Because user folders in /home are expected to have some restrictive permissions. It just could end up creating a permissions mess, so it's better to just avoid entirely. For this example we're going to make use of a share called data . The data folder has sub-folders for torrents and usenet and each of these have sub-folders for tv , movie and music downloads to keep things neat. The media folder has nicely named TV , Movies and Music sub-folders, this is your library and what you\u2019d pass to Plex, Emby or JellyFin.

It is the easiest way to get started. While easy to use, it has a major drawback. Mainly losing the ability to hardlink or instant move, resulting in a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used. Breakdown of the Folder Structure Torrent clients qBittorrent, Deluge, ruTorrent The reason why we use /data/torrents for the torrent client is because it only needs access to the torrent files.

This is faster then the GUI and after installing, it shows up in the Docker GUI. Thanks to faxity for the initial compose that I used to create the Synology Guide. And a very big thanks to Bokkoman and BZwart that updated this Guide for DSM 7 and also offered their help on discord as Synology Support Team. Introduction This page will provide you with guidance on how to install several Docker images to your Synology system. We highly recommend to read the full guide, that way you have a better understanding of what you do, in case you later decide to make changes. Automated Script Automated script ( Use this script at your own risk ) - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Warning Though, we offer a short way out. This is intended as a quick way to do everything that is written on this page within one script. And is only for initial setup. After that, you need to manage it yourself. Rerunning the script will reset all personal changes made in the compose/env. The script is only tested on Synology DSM7.1. We are not held reliable if anything breaks on your system. Use at your own risk To get this working you will need to enable terminal access (SSH) and home folders. Be sure to delete current running Docker containers related to this guide (ie. *arr apps, download clients), backup settings before you do. To enable SSH on your Synology take a look HERE . To enable Home folders, go to Control Panel > User & Group > Advanced > Enable user home service at the bottom. When you enabled these two settings, run the following commands in your favorite terminal app and follow the onscreen questions. curl -sL git.io/syno-script > ~/syno-script sudo bash ~/syno-script Install Docker You need to install Docker from the Package Center . This should also create a share named docker , check File Station if it is present. Create the main share Attention To get Hardlinks and Atomic-Moves working with your Synology you will need to make use of ONE share with subfolders. We will use a new share named data (lowercase) for all your library media. Later in this guide, we will fill this share with subfolders. To create a new share: Control Panel > Shared Folder > click Create > choose Create Shared Folder Name this shared folder data . You can disable the trash can. Click next until you are done. Create a user For this, we are going to create a new user that only has access to the share(s) that we use for this guide. Go to Control Panel > User & Group In the User section, create a new user. Name it whatever you like, but for this guide we will use docker . Fill out the rest of the information, generate a password or type your own. Click next, you will now be able to select which group this user will belong to, it should only be users . Click Next . Assign shared folder permissions In this screen you will be able to select which Shares this user will have access to, click No Access on the top, this will deny all access. Now only select Read/Write on the shares docker and data . Click Next until you reach Assign application permissions Assign application permissions In this screen you will be able to select which application this user will have access to, Check Deny for all applications. Continue to click Next until you are finished. SSH You are mostly going to use the terminal. Some parts will need the Synology web GUI. To enable terminal, you need to enable SSH in the Synology Settings. Control Panel > Terminal & SNMP > Enable SSH service Then use a program like Putty to SSH into your Synology. Enter the login information of a Synology user account that has admin priveliges, as only members of the 'administrators' user group are able to use SSH. If you get a popup asking if you want to trust the key, Just press OK or ACCEPT PUID and PGID In order for the Docker container to access the shares on the Synology, we need to know the user ID (PUID) and group ID (PGID) from the docker user we just created. Go into your terminal app, login to your synology ssh. Once logged in type id $user . Change $user to the newly created username docker . This will show you the UID (aka PUID). Which in this screenshot is 1035 for the docker user and the GID (aka PGID) which is 100 for the users group. Remember these values for later use. Attention It is not recommended to use (anymore) your admin/main user account. That is why we just created a new user. Folder Structure For this example we're going to make use of the share called data . On the host (Synology) terminal you will need to add /volume1/ before it. So /volume1/data The data folder has sub-folders for torrents and usenet and each of these have sub-folders for tv , movie and music downloads to keep things neat. The library folder has nicely named tv , movies and music sub-folders, this is your library and what you\u2019d pass to Plex, Emby or JellyFin. These subfolders you need to create your self. I'm using lower case on all folder on purpose, being Linux is case sensitive. data \u251c\u2500\u2500 torrents \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv \u251c\u2500\u2500 usenet \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv \u2514\u2500\u2500 media \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv The default path setup suggested by some docker developers that encourages people to use mounts like /movies , /tv and /downloads is very suboptimal and it makes them look like two or three file systems, even if they aren\u2019t ( Because of how Docker\u2019s volumes work ). It is the easiest way to get started. While easy to use, it has a major drawback. Mainly losing the ability to hardlink or instant move, resulting in a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used. Breakdown of the Folder Structure Torrent clients qBittorrent, Deluge, ruTorrent The reason why we use /data/torrents for the torrent client is because it only needs access to the torrent files. In the torrent software settings, you\u2019ll need to reconfigure paths and you can sort into sub-folders like /data/torrents/{tv|movies|music} . data \u2514\u2500\u2500 torrents \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv Usenet clients NZBGet or SABnzbd The reason why we use /data/usenet for the usenet client is because it only needs access to the usenet files. In the usenet software settings, you\u2019ll need to reconfigure paths and you can sort into sub-folders like /data/usenet/{tv|movies|music} . data \u2514\u2500\u2500 usenet \u251c\u2500\u2500 movies \u251c\u2500\u2500 music \u2514\u2500\u2500 tv The Starr Apps Sonarr, Radarr and Lidarr Sonarr, Radarr and Lidarr gets access to everything because the download folder(s) and media folder will look like and be one file system.

Create the needed subfolder Here we will create the needed subfolders for your media library and also for your preferred download client. If you use both then run both commands If you use usenet mkdir -p /volume1/data/ { usenet/ { tv,movies,music } ,media/ { tv,movies,music }} If you use torrents mkdir -p /volume1/data/ { torrents/ { tv,movies,music } ,media/ { tv,movies,music }} Appdata Your appdata will be stored in /volume1/docker/appdata/{appname} These {appname} sub folders you need to create your self. ( This is a limitation of the Synology ) We're going to do this in Putty or a similar program. mkdir -p /volume1/docker/appdata/ { radarr,sonarr,bazarr,plex,pullio } You can add your own sub folders for your download client(s) using the command above, by adding the name to the command. So your appdata folder will look like this. ls -al /volume1/docker/appdata docker \u2514\u2500\u2500 appdata \u251c\u2500\u2500 radarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 sonarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 bazarr \u251c\u2500\u2500 plex \u251c\u2500\u2500 pullio \u2514\u2500\u2500 (your download client, i.e. nzbget; sabnzbd; qbittorrent) Needed files Now we are ready to move to the installation of containers. For this, we need two files: docker-compose.yml .env We will start with downloading the docker-compose.yml file Download this docker-compose.yml to your /volume1/docker/appdata location so you got your important stuff together. Or use the command below: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRaSH-/Guides-Synology-Templates/main/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml -P /volume1/docker/appdata/ Whats included and Whats not included What's included and What's not included - [CLICK TO EXPAND] This docker-compose file will have the following docker containers included. Radarr Sonarr Bazarr (Subtitle searcher and downloader) Plex What's not included (and where are the download clients?). I didn't add a download client to it, because it depends on what you prefer (usenet/torrent) and which client you prefer, so I created a new Repository on Github where I provide and maintain some templates that are ready to use with the main docker-compose.yml . The only thing you need to do is copy/paste what's inside the .yml file in to the main docker-compose.yml , the template also has the command what you need to use to create the appdata folder that we explained earlier. Second we will download the .env file Download this .env to your /volume1/docker/appdata location so you got your important stuff together. Or use this command: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TRaSH-/Guides-Synology-Templates/main/docker-compose/.env -P /volume1/docker/appdata/ Attention MAKE SURE THE FILE KEEPS THE ORIGINAL NAME .env WITH THE DOT BEFORE IT Changes and preparations Tip If you need to edit docker-compose.yml or the .env file we advise to use Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code The .env file we downloaded holds the variables/information you need to change in order for everything to work. I added explanations in the .env file. DOCKERCONFDIR (only change this if you know what you're doing and decide to use another path than this guide used) DOCKERDATADIR (only change this if you know what you're doing and decide to use another path than this guide used) PUID/PGID (this info you got earlier from HERE ) TZ (Change to your timezone, can be found HERE ) Install and Create a task scheduler for Pullio, so your containers stay up to date. The .env holds more variables/information for other containers you don't need to remove those variables and will be only used when you install the other containers. Pullio - Auto update docker-compose the correct way Pullio allows you to automatically update your containers. And send you a notification through various means. In my setup, I use a Discord Webhook. First you need to download Pullio sudo curl -fsSL \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hotio/pullio/master/pullio.sh\" -o /usr/local/bin/pullio sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pullio For Pullio to work, you will need to create in your Task Scheduler a \"Scheduled Task\" that runs for example at 4am at night with root privileges. Control Panel > Task Scheduler > click Create > choose Scheduled task - user defined script Give the task a name so you know what it does. Choose user root . In the Schedule tab choose whenever you want it to check for updates. At Task Settings tab, add the following line in the Run Command section: /usr/local/bin/pullio > /volume1/docker/appdata/pullio/pullio.log 2 > & 1 It can be frustrating to test the script if no docker image updates are available, for that you can run command sudo pullio --debug and the script will behave as if an update is available. If you have set to receive notifications, you should receive them. More info about Pullio HERE Permissions Now we need to make sure that the newly created files and folders have the correct permissions. Note If you're using a different user than docker (the user generated in the beginning), then you need to change the docker:users part in the commands below!!! sudo chown -R docker:users /volume1/data /volume1/docker sudo chmod -R a = ,a+rX,u+w,g+w /volume1/data /volume1/docker Note If you copy files from a different library into the newly created library, you need to rerun these commands. !!! Run the Docker Compose Important make sure you delete/remove all your existing dockers from the Docker GUI and also remove your native installs (in Package Center) of these applications !!! If you had previous installed apps, make a backup of their config folders. When you did all the above steps you only need to run the following commands: cd /volume1/docker/appdata sudo docker-compose up -d You will notice that all the images will be downloaded, after that the containers will be started. If you get a error then look at the error what it says and try to fix it. If you still got issues then put your used docker-compose.yml on 0bin and join the guides-discord here and provide the pastebin link with the error, have patience because of timezone differences. Don't forget to look at the Examples how to setup the paths inside your applications. Attention If you need to do any changes, only edit the docker-compose.yml file. To activate the changes, run the command sudo docker-compose up -d again, from within the /volume1/docker/appdata folder. Any changes you do/did in the GUI will be reverted when you run the docker-compose command. Just don't use the GUI, only for information purposes !!! Docker-Compose Commands docker-compose commands - [CLICK TO EXPAND] sudo docker-compose up -d (This Docker-compose command helps builds the image, then creates and starts Docker containers. The containers are from the services specified in the compose file. If the containers are already running and you run docker-compose up, it recreates the container.) sudo docker-compose pull (Pulls an image associated with a service defined in a docker-compose.yml) sudo docker-compose down (The Docker-compose down command also stops Docker containers like the stop command does. But it goes the extra mile. Docker-compose down, doesn\u2019t just stop the containers, it also removes them.) sudo docker system prune -a --volumes --force (Remove all unused containers, networks, images (both dangling and unreferenced), and optionally, volumes.)

Enter the Plex port you want to use. (default: 32400 ) Click on Apply and when everything is setup correctly, your Plex Media Server should be fully accessible outside of your network, so you can connect to your Plex server from outside.

Set the maximum bitrate of a remote stream from this server. Agents This can be ignored if you use the new Plex agents, The new agent settings are now managed \u201cper library\u201d. Library Scan my library automatically When a change is detected in the source location for a library\u2019s content, the appropriate library will be scanned. This function relies on the computer\u2019s operating system providing the \u201csomething changed\u201d trigger. Some operating systems don\u2019t provide this trigger and content mounted via a network will also typically not work. If your library doesn\u2019t automatically scan, you may have to set a periodical scan or do it manually. Suggested: Enabled TIP - Autoscan - [CLICK TO EXPAND] If for some reason ex. your operating systems don\u2019t provide this trigger or your storage is mounted on a network (SMB/NFS/Cloud Storage) or your library just doesn't automatically scan, or is just plain impractical, You might want to consider using autoscan. IBRACORP (A Youtube channel I collaborate with) has a video explaining it in further detail. Please don't forget to check out his other Unraid Video's HERE Run a partial scan when changes are detected When changes to library folders are detected, only scan the folder which changed rather than scanning the entire content location. This works together with the normal Update my library automatically setting (and requires that setting to be enabled). Suggested: Enabled Include music libraries in automatic updates I don't do music, so this choice is up to you, and I won't be covering it. Scan my library periodically Turning this on will cause your Plex Media Server to run scans on your libraries using the designated interval. Suggested: Disabled Do you need a extra scan for your library to recognize new media? Empty trash automatically after every scan With this option enabled, when an item\u2019s file is deleted from the drive, it will be removed from the Plex library on the next scan. Disabling this option keeps the item in the library with an overlay over the item\u2019s poster when the item is removed. Suggested: Enabled Allow media deletion The owner of the server will be allowed to delete media files from disk. Suggested: Disabled In my opinion Plex shouldn't touch your media files. Use Sonarr/Radarr to manage your media library. (For extra security I've setup Plex with Read Only access to the media library) Run scanner tasks at a lower priority On low-powered systems (e.g. ARM-based NAS devices), it can be beneficial to run scanner tasks at a lower priority than other tasks. This can help ensure they do not interfere with regular streaming. Suggested: Enabled Makes sure it uses less resources and ensure they do not interfere with regular streaming. Generate video preview thumbnails This option creates a series of preview thumbnails from a media item when it is analyzed. These images are used by some Plex apps when you move back and forward in an app with the timeline scrubber. They\u2019ll also be displayed in Now Playing when someone is streaming from you so that you can see where they are in the video. Suggested: Never Besides that, it uses a lot of disk space and high I/O, No one in my family uses FastForward/Rewind but they use the skip forward/backward. ATTENTION Creating these images can Take a considerable amount of time Use a lot of CPU resources Increase the storage space used The images are stored in your Plex database location (/config) so be careful you don\u2019t fill the drive Generate intro video markers You can choose to have TV episodes analyzed to try and detect when the \u201cintro\u201d occurs during playback. When detected, apps will then offer a Skip Intro button, allowing you to quickly jump over the intro. Suggested: as a scheduled task or Suggested: as a scheduled task and when media is added Generate chapter thumbnails Chapter thumbnails provide images in the chapter view on supported apps. They can take a little time to generate and consume very minor additional disk space. Suggested: as a scheduled task or Suggested: as a scheduled task and when media is added Network Enable IPv6 support Enable IPv6 support. Suggested: Disabled If you're not sure your network 100% works with ip6 don't Enable it . Secure connections Choose how your Plex Media Server handles secure connections. Suggested: Preferred Accept and prefer secure connections when they\u2019re available for a Plex app, but allow regular HTTP connections if the app doesn\u2019t support secure connections or if one can\u2019t be established Preferred network interface For users with multiple network cards or systems such as NAS or Docker where there is always another network interface which Plex client applications may try to use to connect to the Plex Media Server, with this option you can ensure that your local Plex clients would only try that interface. Attention If you have enabled Remote Access enabled and are having Plex automatically map the port (as opposed to specifying a port manually), then Plex Media Server has no control over which network interface is used for an automatically-mapped port. Thus, it\u2019s possible that Remote Access connections could come through an interface other than the one specified here. Suggested: Whatever suits your setup Strict TLS configuration If this setting is enabled, it prevents Plex Media Server from using or accepting the deprecated TLSv1.0 and v1.1 protocols, as well as legacy weak ciphers. May prevent older clients from connecting. The vast majority of users will have no reason to enable this option (and receive no benefit from doing so). Suggested: Disabled Enable local network discovery (GDM) Enable \u201cG\u2019Day Mate\u201d discovery. This is used to allows Plex apps and servers to find each other automatically on a local network. Suggested: Enabled Remote streams allowed per user You can set the maximum number of simultaneous streams each remote user is allowed to have. Suggested: Whatever suits your setup LAN Networks It lets you specify which IP addresses or networks will be considered to be \u201clocal\u201d to you. Suggested: Your local IP/netmasks If your local devices are seen as remote devices, then this could solve your issue. (Do not include spaces or tabs.) Treat WAN IP As LAN Bandwidth Allows incoming requests from this network\u2019s WAN IP address to be treated as LAN requests in terms of bandwidth. This often occurs when DNS rebinding protection is in place and clients on the LAN cannot contact the server directly but instead have to go through the WAN IP address. Suggested: Enabled Enable Relay The Relay allows connections to the server through a proxy relay when the server is not accessible otherwise. Relay connections are bandwidth limited. Suggested: Disabled I've seen several reports where people that had this Enabled had playback issues because it seems to be limited at 2 Mbps. Custom server access URLs A comma-separated list of URLs (either HTTP or HTTPS), which will be published to plex.tv for server discovery. This can be very useful in a few cases: if you\u2019re using a reverse proxy in front of the media server, or if your networking configuration is otherwise unique. For instance, if you have your own custom domain with subdomain. Suggested: Depending on your setup Example: https://plex.mycustomdomain.com:32400 Webhooks This feature can be enabled to allow your server to send events to external services. For example Notifiarr Transcoders Transcoder quality This will influence the quality used when transcoding media. Suggested: Automatic Most users should leave it set to Automatic. Hardware-Accelerated Streaming is not affected by this setting. Transcoder temporary directory Directory to use when transcoding temporary files for streaming. Suggested: Depending on your setup, if possible, your RAM (disk) Speeds up transcoding and less I/O, transcode data is temporary and doesn't need to be writing to a disk. If you run docker set this to /transcode and map it to /tmp/plex Default Linux only allocates a max of 50% of total system RAM to any ram directories (ie. /tmp, /dev/shm, etc.) WARNING YOU SHOULD NOT SPECIFY A LOCATION THAT RESIDES ON A NETWORK SHARE/DISK. Enable HDR tone mapping This feature allows Plex Media Server to maintain high visual fidelity of content, by applying tone mapping to convert it to SDR when transcoding HDR content. Suggested: Depending on your setup Most HDR content will be in 4K resolution. If your platform has to use software transcoding to perform the tone mapping, then it may well struggle convert 4K content in real-time, unless you\u2019re running on a very powerful system. Note Plex\u2019s tone mapping support should generally be able to produce good color mapping and help avoid the \u201cwashed out\u201d colors that occur when converting HDR content without tone mapping. Use hardware acceleration when available To use Hardware-Accelerated Streaming in Plex Media Server. Suggested: Enabled Use hardware-accelerated video encoding To use Hardware-Accelerated Encoding in Plex Media Server. Suggested: Enabled Manage Libraries Here you will find your libraries you've added to your Plex Media Server. Examples - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Movies (/data/media/movies) Movies-4K/Movies-UHD (/data/media/movies4k) / (/data/media/movies-uhd) Movies-Kids (/data/media/movies-kids) Movies-Anime (/data/media/movies-anime) TV (/data/media/tv) TV-4k/TV-UHD (/data/media/tv-4k) / (/data/media/tv-uhd) TV-Kids (/data/media/tv-kids) TV-Anime (/data/media/tv-anime) Anime (/data/media/anime) etc I will only cover the libraries settings for Movies and TV shows Movies The new version of the Plex Movie agent/scanner Suggested: Plex Movie Besides being much faster at scanning and getting metadata, one of the benefits of the new agent is that all agent settings are set at the library level, so that different libraries using the same agent can have different agent settings. When scanning this library, use local posters and artwork if present. (Local subtitles files will be used whether this is enabled or not) Suggested: Enabled I had this enabled because I thought it was needed for local subtitles (.srt), but after research it seems it isn't needed. If you want you could disable it, the choice is yours. When scanning this library, prefer embedded tags and local files if present. Suggested: Disabled If enabled you could end up with weird movie naming you don't want, happens especially from releases from RARBG Automatically create collections when there are more than the selected number of items for an available collection. Suggested: 2 Only show collections when you have more than one item in your library This option creates a series of preview thumbnails from a media item when it is analyzed. These images are used by some Plex apps when you move back and forward in an app with the timeline scrubber. They\u2019ll also be displayed in Now Playing when someone is streaming from you so that you can see where they are in the video. ATTENTION Creating these images can take a considerable amount of time , CPU resources , and increase the storage space used . The images are stored in your Plex database so be careful you don\u2019t fill the drive Suggested: Disabled Besides that, it uses a lot of disk space and high I/O, No one in my family uses FastForward/Rewind but they use the skip forward/backward. This deletes the preview thumbnails it generated before you disabled this option If you want to show your Collection in your library Suggested: Disabled When Disabled your movies will show up normally when you use library view, This doesn't mean it will disable the collection view. TV The new version of the Plex Movie agent/scanner Suggested: Plex TV Series Besides being much faster at scanning and getting metadata, one of the benefits of the new agent is that all agent settings are set at the library level, so that different libraries using the same agent can have different agent settings. How episodes are named on disk. If your naming follows The MovieDB or TheTVDB choose that here. Use season titles when available. When scanning this library, use local posters and artwork if present.

Generate intro detection for items in this library when enabled in server settings.

These have been collected from either discussions on Discord or that I created with help from others. Special thanks to rg9400 , bakerboy448 and Team Radarr. With Radarr V3, Custom Formats are much more advanced/powerful than with v0.2, although this also means a Custom Format is much more complicated to setup. After requesting it at Team Radarr, we now have the option to import/export the Custom Formats in a JSON format. This makes it easier to share the Custom Formats. I also made 3 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to upgrade Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to upgrade your existing Custom Formats. How to setup Quality Profiles . Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats to help you to setup your quality profiles for your personal needs. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Format preferences will be used instead. Questions or Suggestions?

It adds static metadata upon the PQ10 format. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia HDR10 Media Profile, more commonly known as HDR10, is an open HDR standard announced on 27 August 2015 by the Consumer Technology Association. It is the most widespread of the HDR formats. It is not backward compatible with SDR displays. It is technically limited to a maximum of 10,000 nits peak brightness; however, HDR10 content is commonly mastered with a peak brightness between 1000 and 4000 nits. HDR10 lacks dynamic metadata. On HDR10 displays that have lower color volume than the HDR10 content (e.g. lower peak brightness capability), the HDR10 metadata provides information to help the display adjust to the video. The metadata, however, is static and constant with respect to each individual video and doesn't inform the display exactly how the content should be adjusted. The interaction between display capabilities, video metadata, and the ultimate output (i.e. the presentation of the video) is mediated by the display, with the result that the original producer's intent may not be preserved.

Both are just names to describe the best possible currently for the movie. To be clear, the final digital films on the Mastered in 4K Blu-rays still only have the same 1920 x 1080 pixels of actual resolution as normal Blu-rays. But the argument goes that because these full HD files were derived from higher-resolution masters, their images will be more precise, with better colors, less noise, and enhanced sharpness and detail. Not least because the higher-resolution mastering process will provide more detail from the original print for the Blu-ray masters to draw on when going through their (hopefully\u2026) frame-by-frame compression process. Another important element of the Mastered in 4K discs is that they\u2019re all mastered with \u2018x.v.YCC\u2019 color specification. This delivers an expanded color range closer to that contained in original source material.

If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time. Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done. It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265. The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people Microsized & Wrong Source It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases. And the few groups that do use the correct source suffer from it.

It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese.

These have been collected from either discussions on Discord or that I created with help from others. Special thanks to rg9400 , bakerboy448 and Team Radarr. With Radarr V3, Custom Formats are much more advanced/powerful than with v0.2, although this also means a Custom Format is much more complicated to setup. After requesting it at Team Radarr, we now have the option to import/export the Custom Formats in a JSON format. This makes it easier to share the Custom Formats. I also made 3 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to upgrade Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to upgrade your existing Custom Formats. How to setup Quality Profiles . Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats to help you to setup your quality profiles for your personal needs. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Radarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Format preferences will be used instead. Questions or Suggestions?

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia HDR10 Media Profile, more commonly known as HDR10, is an open HDR standard announced on 27 August 2015 by the Consumer Technology Association. It is the most widespread of the HDR formats. It is not backward compatible with SDR displays. It is technically limited to a maximum of 10,000 nits peak brightness; however, HDR10 content is commonly mastered with a peak brightness between 1000 and 4000 nits. HDR10 lacks dynamic metadata. On HDR10 displays that have lower color volume than the HDR10 content (e.g. lower peak brightness capability), the HDR10 metadata provides information to help the display adjust to the video. The metadata, however, is static and constant with respect to each individual video and doesn't inform the display exactly how the content should be adjusted. The interaction between display capabilities, video metadata, and the ultimate output (i.e. the presentation of the video) is mediated by the display, with the result that the original producer's intent may not be preserved.

But the argument goes that because these full HD files were derived from higher-resolution masters, their images will be more precise, with better colors, less noise, and enhanced sharpness and detail. Not least because the higher-resolution mastering process will provide more detail from the original print for the Blu-ray masters to draw on when going through their (hopefully\u2026) frame-by-frame compression process. Another important element of the Mastered in 4K discs is that they\u2019re all mastered with \u2018x.v.YCC\u2019 color specification.

Anime Dual Audio , Uncensored and 10bit can be given positive scores if you want to prefer content with these attributes. Anime Raws and Dubs Only are negatively scored, however if you prefer these attributes you can give them a positive score. Once the custom formats have been imported you can set the scores as above. To do this go to Settings => Profiles and select the Remux-1080p - Anime profile that was setup before. In the profile enter the scores as per the above table in this section. After you are done it should look like the image above. Dual Audio Scoring If you prefer Dual Audio releases you have a few options depending on your preference. If you want to prefer Dual Audio within the same tier give the CF a score of 10 , if you want it to be preferred a tier above give the CF a score of 101 , and if you want to prefer it over any tiers give the CF a score of 2000 . If you must have Dual Audio releases set the Minimum Custom Format Score to 2000 in the Remux-1080p - Anime profile that you setup earlier. Using this scoring you will still benefit from the tiers if a better release group does a Dual Audio release. Below is an example of the scoring set to prefer Dual Audio over any tier. Uncensored Scoring Note Most BDs are uncensored by default, so most groups do not include that in the name. If you prefer Uncensored releases you have a few options depending on your preference. If you want to prefer Uncensored within the same tier give the CF a score of 10 , if you want it to be preferred a tier above give the CF a score of 101 . Using this scoring you will still benefit from the tiers if a better release group does an Uncensored release. Below is an example of the scoring set to prefer Uncensored a tier above. Finishing up Once you have set your preferred scoring you will need to make two more changes to your Remux-1080p - Anime profile. Make sure Upgrades Allowed is ticked then set the Upgrade Until section to Bluray-1080p and the Upgrade Until Custom Format Score to 10000 and set Language to Original After this has been done your profile should look like below. This is an example of the Default Scoring setup.

Cette page est aussi disponible en Fran\u00e7ais: Guide en Fran\u00e7ais . So what is the best way to set up the Custom Formats and which one to use with which scores to get French and English Audio? Keep in mind that most releases are MULTi (understand DUAL audio, original and French audio) and it will be difficult to only have French audio, unless you are willing to get 720p, or you are only looking for French movies. Regarding quality there isn't a best setup, it depends on your setup (hardware devices) and your own personal preferences. Some prefer high quality audio (HD Audio), others high quality video. Many prefer both. TRaSH created a flowchart to make your decision/choices easier. Remember that this chart does not include any of the following Custom Formats and you will still need to read this guide to get MULTi releases. Basics It is quite important that you follow and understand what is envisioned by Trash's guide: Adding Custom Formats, as explained in How to import Custom Formats . Setting up a quality Profile to make use of the Custom Formats, as explained in How to setup Quality Profiles | Basics section . Mandatory The only change that is needed and mandatory for French Custom Formats to work is to set the preferred language profile for your releases to Any . Screenshot example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Info We do choose Any for the language profile, as otherwise an English movie identified with French audio in Radarr will not be grabbed and vice-versa. I am only interested in French subs (VOSTFR) There is two options: Using TRaSH's guide and Bazarr This is the preferred method. Set up Radarr using How to setup Quality Profiles | Which Quality Profile should you choose . Set up Bazarr . It will do an amazing job for getting your subtitle on every movies. Enjoy your movies with subs. (Optional) Add the VOSTFR Custom Format with a score of 1000 . Using the following examples and the VOSTFR Custom Format Continue to read this page. Ignore any mention of MULTi Custom Formats . Add the VOSTFR Custom Format with a score of 1000 . Usages There is two ways of using those French Custom Formats, with and without the Guide's original Group tiers (which can be found there: Collection of Custom Formats ). To illustrate this, you will see an \"Original mix (optional)\" section in each of the examples below. You need to understand that if you add the Custom Formats from this optional section if Radarr do not find a MULTi you will still have a good scoring for single audio. Attention If you use the \"Original mix (optional)\" . You need to understand that even if in the beginning the main focus of those French Custom Formats is to work alongside the original ones. You could end up with a single audio release when a MULTi release exists. This is because it was not scored high enough to trump the other scoring. Examples of Quality Profile Attention All the used scores and combination of Custom Formats in this Guide are tested to get the desired results and prevent download loops as much as possible. From experience most of the time when people change scores or leave out certain CF that work together they end up with undesired results. If you're unsure or have questions do not hesitate to ask for help on Discord French Audio Versions Those are all optional and only there to rename your release or to avoid a certain type of French Audio. Examples: You do not want VFQ or VQ audio, in this case you will put them at -10000 instead of 0 . You only want VOSTFR, in this case you will ignore any mention of MULTi Custom Formats and give the VOSTFR Custom Format a score of 1000 .

Indicates soundtrack in the original language, with French subtitles [1] VF is included under the VFQ Custom Format, but it should be noted that it was often mismatched with VFF instead of VFQ pre-2022. [2] VF[1-9] is included under the VFI Custom Format. [3] It should be noted that SUBFRENCH is included in this Custom Format. However, SUB often means that the subtitle was embedded inside the picture (hardcoded). French releases tend to mix the two, leading to some VOSTFR being labelled as SUBFRENCH and SUBFRENCH as VOSTFR. Indexers renaming in Prowlarr Some Indexers in Prowlarr can rename MULTi releases to MULTi.TRUEFRENCH or MULTi.FRENCH . I do not recommend using such a feature along with those Custom Formats as it can lead to false positives from the VFF or VFQ Custom Formats.

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 . EVO (no WEBDL): This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match. Obfuscated: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike renamed releases) Retags: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike retagged releases) Scene: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike scene releases) x265 (no HDR/DV): This blocks 720/1080p (HD) releases that are encoded in x265. - More info HERE .

MA is the only one with a score because of their higher bitrate and quality compared to other streaming services. Audio Advanced Custom Formats are not included to the encodes profile, as you will hardly find HD audio with HD Bluray Encodes. With HD Bluray Encodes it is suggested to go for quality. If you also want HD audio formats you should go for the Remuxes or UHD Encodes. Use the following main settings in your profile. Make sure you don't check the BR-DISK. The reason why WEB-DL 720p is not selected is because you will hardly find any releases that aren't done as 1080p WEB-DL. Tip The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked. Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches. Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked. Qualities within the same group are equal. Only checked qualities are wanted. This is why it's recommended to move the selected quality to the top of the list. Source: Wiki Servarr Workflow Logic - [CLICK TO EXPAND] When the WEB-1080p is released it will download the WEB-1080p. (streaming services) When the Bluray-1080p is released it will upgrade to the Bluray-1080p. The downloaded media will be upgraded to any of the added Custom Formats until a score of 10000 . UHD Bluray + WEB If you prefer High Quality UHD Encodes (Bluray-2160p) Size: 20-60 GB for a Bluray-2160p depending on the running time. Information regarding HD audio It should be noted that many problems can arise from this profile if you use the HD audio Custom Formats, as: French Scene rules assert that the French audio should be the first (default) audio in a MULTi release. The rules state that only the best audio (whether original or FR) should be mentioned in the title. Some movies (and TV shows, mostly from the pre-streaming era) lack an equivalent FR audio track to the original audio's highest one. Resulting in the following: The quality of the audio in the release's title could not be the French one. The French audio could be of lesser quality than the titled one. Radarr will only score pre-import audio by the release title. Post-import by the release's first (default) audio (after ffprobe). The final score for the release can be lower than the pre-import. Tip This is why the Group tiers exist; it tries to get hold of the groups that tend to get the best original and French audio for a release. However, it is not infallible, and, once again, a movie may not have an equivalent FR audio track to the original audio's highest one.

The rules state that only the best audio (whether original or FR) should be mentioned in the title. Some movies (and TV shows, mostly from the pre-streaming era) lack an equivalent FR audio track to the original audio's highest one. Resulting in the following: The quality of the audio in the release's title could not be the French one. The French audio could be of lesser quality than the titled one. Radarr will only score pre-import audio by the release title. Post-import by the release's first (default) audio (after ffprobe). The final score for the release can be lower than the pre-import.

Indicates soundtrack in the original language, with French subtitles [1] VF is included under the VFQ Custom Format, but it should be noted that it was often mismatched with VFF instead of VFQ pre-2022. [2] VF[1-9] is included under the VFI Custom Format. [3] It should be noted that SUBFRENCH is included in this Custom Format. However, SUB often means that the subtitle was embedded inside the picture (hardcoded). French releases tend to mix the two, leading to some VOSTFR being labelled as SUBFRENCH and SUBFRENCH as VOSTFR. Indexers renaming in Prowlarr Some Indexers in Prowlarr can rename MULTi releases to MULTi.TRUEFRENCH or MULTi.FRENCH . I do not recommend using such a feature along with those Custom Formats as it can lead to false positives from the VFF or VFQ Custom Formats.

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 . EVO (no WEBDL): This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match. Obfuscated: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike renamed releases) Retags: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike retagged releases) Scene: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike scene releases) x265 (no HDR/DV): This blocks 720/1080p (HD) releases that are encoded in x265. - More info HERE .

MA is the only one with a score because of their higher bitrate and quality compared to other streaming services. Use the following main settings in your profile. Make sure you don't check the BR-DISK. The reason why I didn't select the WEB-DL 720p is because you will hardly find any releases that aren't done as 1080p WEB-DL. Tip The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked. Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches. Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked. Qualities within the same group are equal.

Information regarding HD audio It should be noted that many problems can arise from this profile if you use the HD audio Custom Formats, as: French Scene rules assert that the French audio should be the first (default) audio in a MULTi release. The rules state that only the best audio (whether original or FR) should be mentioned in the title. Some movies (and TV shows, mostly from the pre-streaming era) lack an equivalent FR audio track to the original audio's highest one. Resulting in the following: The quality of the audio in the release's title could not be the French one. The French audio could be of lesser quality than the titled one. Radarr will only score pre-import audio by the release title. Post-import by the release's first (default) audio (after ffprobe). The final score for the release can be lower than the pre-import.

Vous devez comprendre que si vous ajoutez les Formats Personnalis\u00e9s de cette section optionnelle, si Radarr ne trouve pas de MULTi, vous aurez toujours un bon score pour l'audio anglais. Attention Si vous utilisez le \"Mix original (optionnel)\" . Vous devez comprendre que m\u00eame si l'objectif principal de ces Formats Personnalis\u00e9s est de travailler en parall\u00e8le avec les formats du guide original. Vous pouvez vous retrouver avec un seul audio alors qu'il existe une version MULTi. La raison est que la release n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9e assez haut pour l'emporter sur les autres scores. Exemples de Profil Attention All the used scores and combination of Custom Formats in this Guide are tested to get the desired results and prevent download loops as much as possible. From experience most of the time when people change scores or leave out certain CF that work together they end up with undesired results. If you're unsure or have questions do not hesitate to ask for help on Discord Type de versions fran\u00e7aises Ces Formats sont optionnels et ne sont l\u00e0 que pour renommer votre fichier ou pour \u00e9viter un certain type de version fran\u00e7aise. Exemples : Vous ne voulez pas de VFQ ou VQ, dans ce cas, vous leur attribuerez un score de -10000 au lieu de 0 .

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 . EVO (no WEBDL): This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match. Obfuscated: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike renamed releases) Retags: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike retagged releases) Scene: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike scene releases) x265 (no HDR/DV): This blocks 720/1080p (HD) releases that are encoded in x265. - More info HERE . But it will allow x265 releases if they have HDR and/or DV Being that some NF releases won't be released as 4k, but you want to have DV/HDR releases. In your quality profile use the following score for this Custom Format: -10000 Don't use this together with x265 (HD) , Only ever include one of them TRaSH recommandations ( en anglais ) I suggest to follow the following Guides first.

Les Formats Personnalis\u00e9s Audio Advanced ne sont pas inclus dans le profil d'encodage, car vous trouverez difficilement de l'audio HD avec ce type d'encodages.

Utilisez les param\u00e8tres suivants dans votre profil. Assurez-vous de ne pas cocher le BR-DISK. La raison pour laquelle le WEB-DL 720p n'est pas s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 est que vous ne trouverez pratiquement aucune release qui ne soit pas faite en 1080p WEB-DL. Tip The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked. Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches. Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked. Qualities within the same group are equal. Only checked qualities are wanted. This is why it's recommended to move the selected quality to the top of the list. Source: Wiki Servarr Logique et fonctionnement - [CLIQUEZ POUR AFFICHER] En fonction de ce qui est disponible en premier, la logique sera la suivante : Lorsque le WEB-1080p deviendra disponible, le m\u00e9dia sera t\u00e9l\u00e9charger en WEB-1080p.

Le m\u00e9dia sera mis \u00e0 niveau en fonction des formats personnalis\u00e9s ajout\u00e9s jusqu'\u00e0 l'obtention d'un score de 10000 .

Informations concernant les audios HD Il convient de noter que de divers probl\u00e8mes peuvent survenir avec ce profil si vous utilisez les formats personnalis\u00e9s de l'audio HD, car : Les r\u00e8gles de la Sc\u00e8ne fran\u00e7aise stipulent que l'audio fran\u00e7ais doit \u00eatre le premier audio (celui par d\u00e9faut) dans une version MULTi. Les r\u00e8gles stipulent que seul le meilleur son (qu'il soit original ou FR) doit \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9 dans le titre. Certains films (et \u00e9missions de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, principalement de l'\u00e8re pr\u00e9-streaming) ne disposent pas d'une piste audio FR \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 la piste la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e de l'audio original. En cons\u00e9quence, les situations ci-apr\u00e8s peuvent \u00eatre observ\u00e9es : La qualit\u00e9 de l'audio dans le titre de la release pourrait ne pas \u00eatre celle de la version fran\u00e7aise. L'audio fran\u00e7ais pourrait \u00eatre de moins bonne qualit\u00e9 que l'audio titr\u00e9. Radarr n'\u00e9value que les fichiers audio pr\u00e9-importation en fonction du titre de la release. Apr\u00e8s l'importation, par la premi\u00e8re piste audio (par d\u00e9faut) de la release (apr\u00e8s ffprobe). La note finale de la release peut \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle obtenue avant l'importation. Tip Les Formats Personnalis\u00e9s de Groupes P2P existent pour cette raison ; ils essaient de regrouper les groupes qui ont tendance \u00e0 obtenir les meilleures pistes audio originales et fran\u00e7aises pour une sortie. Cependant, cette approche n'est pas infaillible et un film peut ne pas avoir une piste audio FR \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 la piste la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e de l'audio original.

Gardez \u00e0 l'esprit que la plupart des releases sont MULTi (comprenez double audio, original et fran\u00e7ais) et qu'il sera difficile d'avoir uniquement l'audio fran\u00e7ais, \u00e0 moins que vous ne soyez pr\u00eat \u00e0 obtenir du 720p, ou que vous ne recherchiez que des films fran\u00e7ais.

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 . EVO (no WEBDL): This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match. Obfuscated: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike renamed releases) Retags: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike retagged releases) Scene: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike scene releases) x265 (no HDR/DV): This blocks 720/1080p (HD) releases that are encoded in x265. - More info HERE .

Les Formats Personnalis\u00e9s Audio Advanced ne sont pas inclus dans le profil d'encodage, car vous trouverez difficilement de l'audio HD avec ce type d'encodages. Et il est conseill\u00e9 de privil\u00e9gier la qualit\u00e9 visuelle. Si vous voulez aussi de l'audio HD, vous devriez opter pour les Remuxes ou les Encodes UHD. Utilisez les param\u00e8tres suivants dans votre profil. Assurez-vous de ne pas cocher le BR-DISK. La raison pour laquelle le WEB-DL 720p n'est pas s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9 est que vous ne trouverez pratiquement aucune release qui ne soit pas faite en 1080p WEB-DL. Tip The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked. Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches. Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked. Qualities within the same group are equal. Only checked qualities are wanted. This is why it's recommended to move the selected quality to the top of the list.

Informations concernant les audios HD Il convient de noter que de divers probl\u00e8mes peuvent survenir avec ce profil si vous utilisez les formats personnalis\u00e9s de l'audio HD, car : Les r\u00e8gles de la Sc\u00e8ne fran\u00e7aise stipulent que l'audio fran\u00e7ais doit \u00eatre le premier audio (celui par d\u00e9faut) dans une version MULTi. Les r\u00e8gles stipulent que seul le meilleur son (qu'il soit original ou FR) doit \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9 dans le titre. Certains films (et \u00e9missions de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, principalement de l'\u00e8re pr\u00e9-streaming) ne disposent pas d'une piste audio FR \u00e9quivalente \u00e0 la piste la plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e de l'audio original. En cons\u00e9quence, les situations ci-apr\u00e8s peuvent \u00eatre observ\u00e9es : La qualit\u00e9 de l'audio dans le titre de la release pourrait ne pas \u00eatre celle de la version fran\u00e7aise. L'audio fran\u00e7ais pourrait \u00eatre de moins bonne qualit\u00e9 que l'audio titr\u00e9. Radarr n'\u00e9value que les fichiers audio pr\u00e9-importation en fonction du titre de la release. Apr\u00e8s l'importation, par la premi\u00e8re piste audio (par d\u00e9faut) de la release (apr\u00e8s ffprobe). La note finale de la release peut \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle obtenue avant l'importation.

There isn't a best setup, it depends on your setup (hardware devices) and your own personal preferences. Some prefer high quality audio (HD Audio), others high quality video. Many prefer both. Here I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats to help you to setup your quality profiles for your personal needs. I created a flowchart to make your decision/choices easier. Basics After you've added the Custom Formats, as explained in How to import Custom Formats . You will need to set it up in the quality Profile you want to use/prefer to make use of the Custom Formats. Settings => Profiles Radarr Custom Formats can be set per profile and isn't global Select the profile that you want to use/prefer. Profile name. Allow upgrades.

More Info Keep upgrading Custom Format until this score is reached. (setting this to 0 means no upgrades will happen based on Custom Formats) Your preferred language profile for your releases. (Original is recommended) At the bottom in your chosen profile you will see the added Custom Formats where you can start setting up the scores. Screenshot example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Attention These screenshots are just examples to show you how it should look and where you need to place the data that you need to add, they aren't always a 100% reflection of the actual data and not always 100% up to date with the actual data you need to add. Always follow the data described in the guide. If you got any questions or aren't sure just click the chat badge to join the Discord Channel where you can ask your questions directly. Keep in mind Custom Formats are made to fine tune your Quality Profile. Generally, quality trumps all Custom formats are controlled by Quality Profiles. The Upgrade Until score prevents upgrading once a release with this desired score has been downloaded. A score of 0 results in the custom format being informational only. The Minimum score requires releases to reach this threshold otherwise they will be rejected. Custom formats that match with undesirable attributes should be given a negative score to lower their appeal. Outright rejections should be given a negative score low enough that even if all of the other formats with positive scores were added, the score would still fall below the minimum.

I decided not to add Audio Advanced Custom Formats to the encodes profile, You will hardly find HD audio with HD Bluray Encodes. With HD Bluray Encodes I personally suggest to go for quality. If you also want HD audio formats I would suggest to go for the Remuxes or UHD Encodes. Use the following main settings in your profile. Make sure you don't check the BR-DISK. The reason why I didn't select the WEB-DL 720p is because you will hardly find any releases that aren't done as 1080p WEB-DL. Tip The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked.

MA is the only one with a score because of their higher bitrate and quality compared to other streaming services. Use the following main settings in your profile. Make sure you don't check the BR-DISK. Tip The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked. Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches. Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked. Qualities within the same group are equal. Only checked qualities are wanted. This is why it's recommended to move the selected quality to the top of the list.

So why such a ridiculously high Upgrade Until Custom and not a score of 100 ? Because I'm too lazy to calculate the maximum for every Quality Profile I use, and I want it to upgrade to the highest possible score anyway.

On a AppleTV, these do not reliably play with the Plex app but will work better with the third-party Infuse app. MP4 files tend to work better than MKV files, obviously MKV is preferable because of its support for lossless audio. ( Incompatible devices will playback with blown out pinks and greens ) Profile 7 - This is what comes with HD Bluray Remuxes. These files will play on an Nvidia Shield (2019), but on most other players will revert to the HDR10 fallback. Profile 8 - This is what comes with (Hybrid) WEB-DL releases (HULU), Hybrid UHD Remux and UHD BluRay releases - all of which have HDR10 fallback. This works with several mainstream media players, but the AppleTV can only play the HDR10 fallback. ( although your TV will incorrectly say that it is playing DV ). Meaning: Neither Infuse nor PLEX for AppleTV will deliver real Dolby Vision with Profile 7/8.

Custom Formats to avoid certain releases How to use a Custom Format to avoid certain releases? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] For Custom Formats you really want to avoid, set it to something really low like -10000 and not something like -10 . Being when you add a Custom Format what you prefer and you set it to something like +10 it could happen that for example the BR-DISK will be downloaded (-10)+(+10)=0 and if your Minimum Custom Format Score is set at 0 .

Only use this if you got specific reasons that you need them. Using it with any kind of Remuxes Quality Profile is useless in my opinion being that 99% of all remuxes are multi audio anyway. You can get better scores using the Audio Advanced Custom Formats. Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format with a score if possible, it's smarter to use the x265 (HD) Custom Format. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a of couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Use x265 only for 4k releases and the x265 (HD) makes sure you still get the x265 releases. Thanks A big Thanks to rg9400 for providing me with info needed to create the Tips section.

MA is the only one with a score because of their higher bitrate and quality compared to other streaming services. I decided not to add Audio Advanced Custom Formats to the encodes profile, You will hardly find HD audio with HD Bluray Encodes. With HD Bluray Encodes I personally suggest to go for quality. If you also want HD audio formats I would suggest to go for the Remuxes or UHD Encodes. Use the following main settings in your profile. Make sure you don't check the BR-DISK. The reason why I didn't select the WEB-DL 720p is because you will hardly find any releases that aren't done as 1080p WEB-DL. Tip The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked. Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches. Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked. Qualities within the same group are equal. Only checked qualities are wanted. This is why it's recommended to move the selected quality to the top of the list. Source: Wiki Servarr Workflow Logic - [CLICK TO EXPAND] When the WEB-1080p is released it will download the WEB-1080p. (streaming services) When the Bluray-1080p is released it will upgrade to the Bluray-1080p. The downloaded media will be upgraded to any of the added Custom Formats until a score of 10000 . So why such a ridiculously high Upgrade Until Custom and not a score of 100 ?

MA is the only one with a score because of their higher bitrate and quality compared to other streaming services. Use the following main settings in your profile. Make sure you don't check the BR-DISK. Tip The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked. Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches. Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked. Qualities within the same group are equal. Only checked qualities are wanted. This is why it's recommended to move the selected quality to the top of the list.

On a AppleTV, these do not reliably play with the Plex app but will work better with the third-party Infuse app. MP4 files tend to work better than MKV files, obviously MKV is preferable because of its support for lossless audio. ( Incompatible devices will playback with blown out pinks and greens ) Profile 7 - This is what comes with HD Bluray Remuxes. These files will play on an Nvidia Shield (2019), but on most other players will revert to the HDR10 fallback. Profile 8 - This is what comes with (Hybrid) WEB-DL releases (HULU), Hybrid UHD Remux and UHD BluRay releases - all of which have HDR10 fallback. This works with several mainstream media players, but the AppleTV can only play the HDR10 fallback. ( although your TV will incorrectly say that it is playing DV ). Meaning: Neither Infuse nor PLEX for AppleTV will deliver real Dolby Vision with Profile 7/8.

One download client ( Two if you prefer Usenet and Torrents ). Your download client has two separate categories (movies-hd, movies-uhd, tv-hd, tv-uhd, etc) Attention You can't use the same root (media library) folder for both Radarr's/Sonarr's Make sure you use two separate root folders in Radarr/Sonarr (movies-hd, movies-uhd, tv-hd, tv-uhd, etc) Option 1 In this example I'm going to use two Radarr instances (The basics is the same for Sonarr). Radarr 1 = My main 4K/2160p (UHD) Radarr. Radarr 2 = My 1080p Radarr that I've setup for a streaming optimized quality profile. 1 This option is best used if you want a 1:1 copy of your Radarr/Sonarr instances Adding the Radarr Sync list In Radarr 2 go to Settings => Lists Click on the + to add a list and select Radarr Then you get a screen with the following options: The name you want to call your Sync list.

This option is best used if you only want to have a few TV shows (or movies if you use this option with Radarr) as 4K/2160p (UHD) Extra preparation In Sonarr 1 go to Settings => Profiles Clone your used profile and rename your profile from Profilename - Copy to Profilename! Adding the Sonarr Sync list In Sonarr 2 go to Settings => Import Lists Click on the + to add a list and select Sonarr Then you get a screen with the following options: The name you want to call your Sync list.

If you have questions or suggestions click the chat badge to join the Discord Support Channel where you can ask your questions directly and get live support. If you're interested in the 1080p streaming optimized quality profile you can join my discord and get access to the Special Quality Profiles channel (access-to-sqp) by accepting the rules. This is a special quality profile I created for people who are really interested in it. This release profile is fine tuned for when you want to run a 2nd Radarr for 1080p, and want minimum to none transcoding and smaller sizes for the second copies. Why choose this quality profile? Streaming optimized (optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms) Small sizes Good quality Only AC3 Audio (downmixed lossless audio track to Dolby Digital 5.1 for optimal compatibility) You want maximum compatibility between all devices and still have a HQ release. You run two instances of Radarr and want both versions or just for the 1080p ones. You want to have minimum to none transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming. \u21a9 Announced : Radarr will consider movies available as soon as they are added to Radarr. This setting is recommended if you have good private trackers that do not have fakes. In Cinemas : Radarr will consider movies available as soon as movies hit cinemas. This option is not recommended. Released : Radarr will consider movies available as soon as the Blu-ray is released. This option is recommended if your indexers contain fakes often. \u21a9 All Episodes : Monitor all episodes except specials Future Episodes : Monitor episodes that have not aired yet Missing Episodes : Monitor episodes that do not have files or have not aired yet Existing Episodes : Monitor episodes that have files or have not aired yet First Season : Monitor all episodes of the first season. All other seasons will be ignored Latest Season : Monitor all episodes of the latest season and future seasons None : No episodes will be monitored \u21a9 Anime : Episodes released using an absolute episode number Daily : Episodes released daily or less frequently that use year-month-day (2017-05-25) Standard : Episodes released with SxxEyy pattern \u21a9","title":"How to Sync 2 Radarr or Sonarr with each other"},{"location":"Radarr/Tips/Sync-2-radarr-sonarr/#how-to-sync-2-radarr-or-sonarr-with-each-other","text":"In this guide I will try to explain how you can sync two (or more) Radarr/Sonarr instances with each other.

If you're interested in the 1080p streaming optimized quality profile you can join my discord and get access to the Special Quality Profiles channel (access-to-sqp) by accepting the rules. This is a special quality profile I created for people who are really interested in it. This release profile is fine tuned for when you want to run a 2nd Radarr for 1080p, and want minimum to none transcoding and smaller sizes for the second copies. Why choose this quality profile? Streaming optimized (optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms) Small sizes Good quality Only AC3 Audio (downmixed lossless audio track to Dolby Digital 5.1 for optimal compatibility) You want maximum compatibility between all devices and still have a HQ release. You run two instances of Radarr and want both versions or just for the 1080p ones. You want to have minimum to none transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming. \u21a9 Announced : Radarr will consider movies available as soon as they are added to Radarr. This setting is recommended if you have good private trackers that do not have fakes. In Cinemas : Radarr will consider movies available as soon as movies hit cinemas. This option is not recommended. Released : Radarr will consider movies available as soon as the Blu-ray is released. This option is recommended if your indexers contain fakes often. \u21a9 All Episodes : Monitor all episodes except specials Future Episodes : Monitor episodes that have not aired yet Missing Episodes : Monitor episodes that do not have files or have not aired yet Existing Episodes : Monitor episodes that have files or have not aired yet First Season : Monitor all episodes of the first season.

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. EVO (no WEBDL): This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match.

So set it as high as possible. The highest preferred quality you can manually enter is 1 less than the Maximum quality. If you use the slider, the preferred quality can be up to 5 lesser than the Maximum quality.

Important Notice Important Notice All the used scores and combination of Custom Formats in this Guide are tested to get the desired results and prevent download loops as much as possible. From experience most of the time when people change scores or leave out certain CF that work together they end up with undesired results. If you're unsure or have questions do not hesitate to ask for help on Discord. Instructions Follow every steps below. Don't skip any steps. Changing the tested recommended scores could result in undesired results. Adding CF not in this guide could result in undesired results.

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 . HDR10+ Boost: [ Optional ] (use this one only if you have a (Samsung) TV that supports HDR10+ and you don't have a Setup that supports DV or you prefer HDR10+ EVO (no WEBDL): This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match. Obfuscated: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike renamed releases) Retags: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike retagged releases) Scene: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike scene releases) x265 (no HDR/DV): This blocks 720/1080p (HD) releases that are encoded in x265. - More info HERE . But it will allow x265 releases if they have HDR and/or DV Being that some NF releases won't be released as 4k, but you want to have DV/HDR releases.

It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 .

No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score.

Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches. Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked. Qualities within the same group are equal.

It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 . HDR10+ Boost: [ Optional ] (use this one only if you have a (Samsung) TV that supports HDR10+ and you don't have a Setup that supports DV or you prefer HDR10+ EVO (no WEBDL): This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match.

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 .

LQ: A collection of known Low Quality groups that are often banned from the the top trackers because the lack of quality or other reasons. 3D: Is 3D still a thing for home use ?

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. DV (WEBDL): This is a special Custom Format that Block WEBDL with Dolby Vision but without HDR10 fallback. This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you can use to prefer Dolby Vision. Most WEBDL from Streaming Services don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup. Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10. Hint [DV WEBDL] = This custom format you need to score depending of your personal use and setup. If you only watch your movies on a setup that completely supports Dolby Vision from start to end then give it a score of 0 or just don't add it. If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then you should add this with a score of -10000 . HDR10+ Boost: [ Optional ] (use this one only if you have a (Samsung) TV that supports HDR10+ and you don't have a Setup that supports DV or you prefer HDR10+ EVO (no WEBDL): This group is often banned for the low quality Blu-ray releases, but their WEB-DL are okay. No-RlsGroup: [ Optional ] Some indexers strip out the release group what could result in LQ groups getting a higher score. For example a lot of EVO releases end up stripping the group name, so they appear as \"upgrades\", and they end up getting a decent score if other things match. Obfuscated: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike renamed releases) Retags: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike retagged releases) Scene: [ Optional ] (use these only if you dislike scene releases) x265 (no HDR/DV): This blocks 720/1080p (HD) releases that are encoded in x265. - More info HERE . But it will allow x265 releases if they have HDR and/or DV Being that some NF releases won't be released as 4k, but you want to have DV/HDR releases.

Anime Delete If you have issues with extra files being downloaded like NCED or NCOP If you have issues with Sonarr picking up a bunch of: NCED NCOP Music Videos OP's Then this script (linux based only) will delete these files and get rid of them and you don't have to worry about them cluttering up your Auto or Manual import process. #!/usr/bin/env bash # Set the following location to your completed download location for Anime. # Usually one of the following paths: # Dockers => /data/{usenet|torrents}/anime # Cloudbox => /mnt/local/downloads/nzbs/nzbget/completed/sonarranime location = \"/your/download/path/here\" find $location -type f \\( -iname \"*op[0-9]*\" -o -iname \"*nced*\" -o -iname \"*ncop*\" -o -iname \"*music video*\" \\) -exec rm -rf {} \\; This script will be called through a custom connection in Sonarr. Copy the contents of the script into whatever filepath Sonarr has access to ( /config/app/ or /appdata/sonarr/scripts ) Edit the location=\"/your/download/path/here\" and make sure it's in quotes. Then save it and chmod +x the script. In Sonarr go to Settings => Connect => Click on the + Symbol => and select Custom Script Change Name to whatever you like. Select On Grab and On Import . Click the Folder icon or type in the path to the script you chose earlier. Now when you download or import any files the script will run and clear out those files that you most likely won't use and if you want them well this script isn't for you. Media Management Note There are a few settings which make life a lot easier when tracking down and keeping certain information for your Anime and with tweaks to make it work better with HamaAgent for Plex. Suggested naming scheme For this I used the Sonarr Recommended naming scheme with only a small change for a formatting error to be fixed and the Series Folder Format for easier matching.

With this option you can fine tune your preference. The Release profile that we're going to use for this example is mainly to prefer P2P releases over Scene releases. (Scene releases are still being downloaded, but replaced once an upgrade is found.) If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you. FAQ - [CLICK TO EXPAND] FAQ Q: Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL? A: I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between quality and size and you often don't see big differences anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc) Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene groups? A: Scene groups always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible. So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also, I noticed that with some scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio. In my opinion the P2P releases are of better quality. There's one scene group that does bring out quality releases -deflate/-inflate . Q: Why do I see so many repacks/propers of Amazon WEB-DLs lately? A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated, the episodes will be REPACKED. Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups? A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile. I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why? Lately I noticed a lot of popup scene releases meaning we need to update often. With this it also means all scene and (yet) unknown groups will be getting a score of 0 and not -50 . I will still keep a eye on them and add the Low Quality Groups to the -100 score and when I find a new P2P group I will add them, resulting in less updates and a more accurate upgrade. Basics This guide is based on WEBDL (Read the FAQ why) that's why we're going to create a quality profile based on WEBDL. Settings => Profiles Select the profile that you want to use/prefer. Tip Starting from 2010 you will be able to find almost anything as WEBDL, 2000-2010 you will only find a few shows as WEBDL in that case you might want to enable HDTV and or 720p . If you want 2160p WEBDL then choose 2160p WEBDL and add the HDR and/or DV regex, 2160p without HDR/DV has no real benefits !!! Sonarr current logic Sonarr current logic - [CLICK TO EXPAND] As of 2021-11-06 the logic is as follows: The Current logic on how downloads are compared is Quality Trumps All Quality Language Preferred Word Score Protocol Episode Count Episode Number Indexer Priority Seeds/Peers (If Torrent) Age (If Usenet) Size Source: Wiki Servarr REPACKS and PROPERs are v2 of Qualities and thus rank above a non-repack of the same quality. Settings => Media Management => File Management => Proper & Repacks Change to Do Not Prefer and use a preferred word regex of /\\b(repack|proper)\\b/i Propers and Repacks First we're need to make sure a P2P release isn't being replaced by a Scene Repack/Proper release! Go to Settings => Media Management We\u00b4re going to set it to Do not Prefer . Then we navigate to Settings => Profiles and click the plus sign. You will get a popup screen that will look like this: Must Contain => add words that the release name MUST HAVE! Must Not Contain => add words that the release name MUST NOT HAVE OR IT WILL BE REJECTED! Preferred => add words you prefer with a certain score. The release will be preferred based on each term's score. Include Preferred when Renaming => When you add {Preferred Words} to your renaming scheme it will add this info. Indexers => Specify what indexer the profile applies to. Tags => create a tag so this is only used by shows that you give this tag to or else it's global. Summary The Number between the [ brackets ] in the following release profiles are the scores the release name will get during an automatic and manual search and with the use of the scores some releases will be preferred over others and even upgraded. The Number between ( brackets ) in the following release profiles are referring to the location where you should add this regex in the release profile corresponding the screenshot above. Important We're going to make use of four separate release profiles. Release Sources (Streaming Service) - Release Profile Profile 1 Note Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming and add {Preferred Words} to your renaming scheme or else you could get download loop issues!!! What it does: When enabled, the block with the Release Source (Streaming Service) in it are then added to the file name which fixes any loops due to Sonarr seeing a new NF rip when an AMZN rip is found. Probably doesn\u2019t happen if cutoff is met, but for anything that is unmet or any forced searches it results in a loop because NF is not in Sonarr\u2019s copy so it upgrades, and loops. Enabling the include in preferred words for AMZN and adding that to the file name fixes that.

Optionals - Release Profile Profile 4 Warning DO NOT Check mark Include Preferred when Renaming Caution These optionals are optional because they should only be added/used if you got a certain use case for it, if you don't understand what the optional is for then you probably don't need it Except the Golden Rule this one is actually a must even that it's added in the optional section If you see certain optional with a positive score and you actually don't want them just add them with a negative score !!! Golden rule This one is actually a must even that it's added in the optional section Why the Must Not Contain entry - [CLICK TO EXPAND] This one blocks/ignores 720/1080p releases that are (re-)encoded in x265. So why did I put /^(?=.*(1080|720))(?=.*((x|h)[ ._-]?265|hevc)).*/i as Must Not Contain and what does it do ? Why ? Quote x265 is good for for 4k stuff or 1080p if they used the the remuxes as source. If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time. Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done. It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265. The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases. And the few groups that do use the correct source suffer from it. That's why I created my own golden rule. 720/1080p => x264 2160p/4k => x265 Add this to your Must not contain (2) /^ ( ? = .* ( 1080 | 720 ))( ? = .* (( x | h )[ ._- ] ?265 | hevc )) .*/i example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Optional - Prefer HDR Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [10] / \\b HDR ( \\b | \\d ) /i Optional - Prefer Dolby Vision Add this to your Preferred (3) with a score of [100] / \\b ( dv | dovi | dolby [ . ] ?vision ) \\b /i Optional - Dislike retags Explanation - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Use this only if you dislike renamed and retagged releases, some indexers/trackers are known to rename or add their own tags to the release name which could mess up your results or naming.

It also seems there is a work around for SABnzbd but i can't confirm being i'm not using Sab. Optional - Ignore Dolby Vision without HDR10 fallback Explanation - [CLICK TO EXPAND] This is a RegEx that ignores DV that don't have the fallback to HDR10, What can results in playback issues like weird colors if you want to play it on a not Dolby Vision compatible setup.

Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0), What results after renaming and FFprobe that the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. It's a common rule that you add the best audio as first. Also they often even rename the release name in to Portuguese. Add this to your Must not contain (2) / \\b ( -alfaHD | -BAT | -BNd | -C \\.

We also had reports of playback/transcoding issues. No main group is actually using it (yet). It's better to ignore this new codec to prevent compatibility issues. Add this to your Must not contain (2) / \\b AV1 \\b /i A little explanation of the scores and why Scores [75]-[100] Release Source. Scores [125]-[150] P2P Groups. Scores [10] Give a repack/proper a higher score but don't trump P2P groups for a Scene fix. Scores [-25] Retagged/Renames/Obfuscated releases. If you're getting often a error message like Has the same filesize as existing file , you might need to consider to remove the [-25] Scores [-100] Groups that mess with the audio or add another preferred language.

The reason why this one get's such a high score is because it's the only quality scene group that exist (till now) and scene groups don't add the Release Sources (Streaming Service) to their release name so they don't get the extra point of the release source regex. \u21a9","title":"Release Profile RegEx (WEB-DL)"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/#release-profile-regex-web-dl","text":"Sonarr V3 has a great feature called Release Profile.

So why did I put /^(?=.*(1080|720))(?=.*((x|h)[ ._-]?265|hevc)).*/i as Must Not Contain and what does it do ? Why ? Quote x265 is good for for 4k stuff or 1080p if they used the the remuxes as source. If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of quality every time. Also, once you go x265, typically that file is done. It can't be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265. The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files, so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and the option to change your files to something else later, then x264. It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases or use the x264 as source what results in low quality releases. And the few groups that do use the correct source suffer from it.

You will get an error that looks a little bit like the following screenshot. So looking at this screenshot it seems we need to make use of Remote Path Mappings How First we navigate in Sonarr to the Settings => Download Clients tab. At the bottom you choose Add new mapping A screen will pop up with the following options: Host => This is the hostname or IP you set in your download client settings. Remote Path => The download path that you've set in your download client. Local Path => The path Sonarr needs to access the same path. Examples QBittorrent Host To find what you need to put in your host you navigate in Sonarr to the Settings => Download Clients Tab. There you open up the download client for this example I will be using QBittorrent This is what you put in your Host in Remote Path Mapping. Remote Path To find what you need to put in your remote path you need to open up your download client and look what you've used there as download location. In QBittorrent navigate to Tools => Options (or ALT+O) and navigate to the Download settings. This is what you add in your Remote Path in Remote Path Mapping. Local Path To find out what you need to put in in your local path you need to know how Sonarr is able to access the files that your download client downloaded. This can be done in different ways. Mounting/Network shares, whatever, but Sonarr needs to have local access to it, so you need to figure out the best way for Sonarr to access the download client's downloaded files yourself.

These have been collected from either discussions on Discord or that I created with help from others. Special thanks to everyone that helped testing and creating these Custom Formats. With Sonarr V4+, Custom Formats are much more advanced/powerful than with the release profiles, although this also means a Custom Format is much more complicated to setup. I also made 3 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to upgrade Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to upgrade your existing Custom Formats. How to setup Quality Profiles . Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. You can use these to get an idea on how to setup your own. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Sonarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Format preferences will be used instead. Questions or Suggestions?

It adds static metadata upon the PQ10 format. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia HDR10 Media Profile, more commonly known as HDR10, is an open HDR standard announced on 27 August 2015 by the Consumer Technology Association. It is the most widespread of the HDR formats. It is not backward compatible with SDR displays. It is technically limited to a maximum of 10,000 nits peak brightness; however, HDR10 content is commonly mastered with a peak brightness between 1000 and 4000 nits. HDR10 lacks dynamic metadata. On HDR10 displays that have lower color volume than the HDR10 content (e.g. lower peak brightness capability), the HDR10 metadata provides information to help the display adjust to the video. The metadata, however, is static and constant with respect to each individual video and doesn't inform the display exactly how the content should be adjusted. The interaction between display capabilities, video metadata, and the ultimate output (i.e. the presentation of the video) is mediated by the display, with the result that the original producer's intent may not be preserved.

HDR capture and displays are capable of brighter whites and deeper blacks. To accommodate this, HDR encoding standards allow for a higher maximum luminance and use at least a 10-bit dynamic range (color depth, compared to 8-bit for non-professional and 10-bit for professional SDR video) in order to maintain precision across this extended range.

If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Just depends on your priorities. So basically if you are storage poor and just need to save space, use x265.

These have been collected from either discussions on Discord or that I created with help from others. Special thanks to everyone that helped testing and creating these Custom Formats. With Sonarr V4+, Custom Formats are much more advanced/powerful than with the release profiles, although this also means a Custom Format is much more complicated to setup. I also made 3 guides related to this one. How to import Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to import the Custom Formats. How to upgrade Custom Formats . Where I will try to explain how to upgrade your existing Custom Formats. How to setup Quality Profiles . Where I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats and show some personal examples that I'm using. You can use these to get an idea on how to setup your own. Tip I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Sonarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Format preferences will be used instead. Questions or Suggestions?

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia HDR10 Media Profile, more commonly known as HDR10, is an open HDR standard announced on 27 August 2015 by the Consumer Technology Association. It is the most widespread of the HDR formats. It is not backward compatible with SDR displays. It is technically limited to a maximum of 10,000 nits peak brightness; however, HDR10 content is commonly mastered with a peak brightness between 1000 and 4000 nits. HDR10 lacks dynamic metadata. On HDR10 displays that have lower color volume than the HDR10 content (e.g. lower peak brightness capability), the HDR10 metadata provides information to help the display adjust to the video. The metadata, however, is static and constant with respect to each individual video and doesn't inform the display exactly how the content should be adjusted. The interaction between display capabilities, video metadata, and the ultimate output (i.e. the presentation of the video) is mediated by the display, with the result that the original producer's intent may not be preserved.

Anime Dual Audio , Uncensored and 10bit can be given positive scores if you want to prefer content with these attributes. Anime Raws and Dubs Only are negatively scored, however if you prefer these attributes you can give them a positive score. Once the custom formats have been imported you can set the scores as above. To do this go to Settings => Profiles and select the Remux-1080p - Anime profile that was setup before. In the profile enter the scores as per the above table in this section. After you are done it should look like the image above. Dual Audio Scoring If you prefer Dual Audio releases you have a few options depending on your preference. If you want to prefer Dual Audio within the same tier give the CF a score of 10 , if you want it to be preferred a tier above give the CF a score of 101 , and if you want to prefer it over any tiers give the CF a score of 2000 . If you must have Dual Audio releases set the Minimum Custom Format Score to 2000 in the Remux-1080p - Anime profile that you setup earlier. Using this scoring you will still benefit from the tiers if a better release group does a Dual Audio release. Below is an example of the scoring set to prefer Dual Audio over any tier. Uncensored Scoring Note Most BDs are uncensored by default, so most groups do not include that in the name. If you prefer Uncensored releases you have a few options depending on your preference. If you want to prefer Uncensored within the same tier give the CF a score of 10 , if you want it to be preferred a tier above give the CF a score of 101 . Using this scoring you will still benefit from the tiers if a better release group does an Uncensored release. Below is an example of the scoring set to prefer Uncensored a tier above. Finishing up Once you have set your preferred scoring you will need to make one more change to your Remux-1080p - Anime profile. Make sure Upgrades Allowed is ticked then set the Upgrade Until section to Bluray-1080p and the Upgrade Until Custom Format Score to 10000 After this has been done your profile should look like below. This is an example of the Default Scoring setup.

There isn't a best setup, it depends on your setup (hardware devices) and your own personal preferences. Some prefer high quality audio (HD Audio), others high quality video. Many prefer both. Here I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats to help you to setup your quality profiles for your personal needs. Attention All the used scores and combination of Custom Formats in this Guide are tested to get the desired results and prevent download loops as much as possible. From experience most of the time when people change scores or leave out certain CF that work together they end up with undesired results. If you're unsure or have questions do not hesitate to ask for help on Discord Basics After you've added the Custom Formats, as explained in How to import Custom Formats . You will need to set it up in the quality Profile you want to use/prefer to make use of the Custom Formats. Settings => Profiles Sonarr Custom Formats can be set per profile and isn't global Select the profile that you want to use/prefer. Profile name. Allow upgrades. Sonarr will stop upgrading quality once (3) is met. Upgrade until the selected quality. The Minimum Custom Format Score allowed to download. More Info Keep upgrading Custom Format until this score is reached. (setting this to 0 means no upgrades will happen based on Custom Formats) At the bottom in your chosen profile you will see the added Custom Formats where you can start setting up the scores. Screenshot example - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Attention These screenshots are just examples to show you how it should look and where you need to place the data that you need to add, they aren't always a 100% reflection of the actual data and not always 100% up to date with the actual data you need to add. Always follow the data described in the guide. If you got any questions or aren't sure just click the chat badge to join the Discord Channel where you can ask your questions directly. Keep in mind Custom Formats are made to fine tune your Quality Profile. Generally, quality trumps all Custom formats are controlled by Quality Profiles. The Upgrade Until score prevents upgrading once a release with this desired score has been downloaded. A score of 0 results in the custom format being informational only. The Minimum score requires releases to reach this threshold otherwise they will be rejected. Custom formats that match with undesirable attributes should be given a negative score to lower their appeal. Outright rejections should be given a negative score low enough that even if all of the other formats with positive scores were added, the score would still fall below the minimum. Sonarr current logic Sonarr current logic - [CLICK TO EXPAND] As of 2021-11-06 the logic is as follows: The Current logic on how downloads are compared is Quality Trumps All Quality Language Preferred Word Score Protocol Episode Count Episode Number Indexer Priority Seeds/Peers (If Torrent) Age (If Usenet) Size Source: Wiki Servarr REPACKS and PROPERs are v2 of Qualities and thus rank above a non-repack of the same quality.

So why such a ridiculously high Upgrade Until Custom and not a score of 500 ? Because I'm too lazy to calculate the maxim FAQ & INFO Why only WEB-DL Why do you only have a release profile for WEB-DL - [CLICK TO EXPAND] I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between quality and size and you often don't see big differences anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc) Why prefer P2P groups Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene groups - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Scene groups always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible. So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also, I noticed that with some scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio. In my opinion the P2P releases are of better quality. There's one scene group that does bring out quality releases -deflate / -inflate . Why so many repacks/propers Why do I see so many repacks/propers of Amazon WEB-DLs lately - [CLICK TO EXPAND] A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated, the episodes will be REPACKED. Custom Formats to avoid certain releases How to use a Custom Format to avoid certain releases? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] For Custom Formats you really want to avoid, set it to something really low like -10000 and not something like -10 . Being when you add a Custom Format what you prefer and you set it to something like +10 it could happen that for example the BR-DISK will be downloaded (-10)+(+10)=0 and if your Minimum Custom Format Score is set at 0 . Custom Formats with a score of 0 What do Custom Formats with a score of 0 do? - [CLICK TO EXPAND] All Custom Formats with a score of 0 are pure informational and don't do anything. Proper and Repacks Proper and Repacks - [CLICK TO EXPAND] I also suggest to change the Propers and Repacks settings in Sonarr Media Management => File Management to Do Not Prefer and use the Repack/Proper Custom Format. This way you make sure the Custom Format preferences will be used instead. Minimum Custom Format Score Minimum Custom Format Score - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Some people suggest not to use negative scores for your Custom Formats and set this option to a higher score then 0. The reason why I don't prefer/use this is because you could limit yourself when some new groups or whatever will be released. Also it makes it much more clear what you prefer and what you want to avoid. Audio Channels Audio Channels - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Personally I wouldn't add the audio channels Custom Formats being you could limit yourself in the amount of releases you're able to get. Only use this if you got specific reasons that you need them. Using it with any kind of Remuxes Quality Profile is useless in my opinion being that 99% of all remuxes are multi audio anyway. You can get better scores using the Audio Advanced Custom Formats. Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format - [CLICK TO EXPAND] Avoid using the x264/x265 Custom Format with a score if possible, it's smarter to use the x265 (HD) Custom Format. Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play support. If you have more than a of couple users, you will notice much more transcoding. Use x265 only for 4k releases and the x265 (HD) makes sure you still get the x265 releases. Thanks Special thanks to everyone that helped testing and creating these Custom Formats.

There isn't a best setup, it depends on your setup (hardware devices) and your own personal preferences. Some prefer high quality audio (HD Audio), others high quality video. Many prefer both. Here I will try to explain how to make the most use of Custom Formats to help you to setup your quality profiles for your personal needs. Attention All the used scores and combination of Custom Formats in this Guide are tested to get the desired results and prevent download loops as much as possible. From experience most of the time when people change scores or leave out certain CF that work together they end up with undesired results.

Keep in mind Custom Formats are made to fine tune your Quality Profile. Generally, quality trumps all Custom formats are controlled by Quality Profiles. The Upgrade Until score prevents upgrading once a release with this desired score has been downloaded. A score of 0 results in the custom format being informational only.

I'm going to show two different options on how you can setup your sync with two Radarr/Sonarr instances. Option 1: This option is best used if you want a 1:1 copy of your Radarr/Sonarr instances as it'll sync everything Option 2: This option is best used if you only want to have a subset of your library Movies/TV Shows as 4K/2160p (UHD) as it filters by quality profile I'm not going to explain how to set up two Radarr/Sonarr instances for your system, being it depends on how you have it installed/running. Radarr Multiple Instance Information and Sonarr Multiple Instance Information Preparation For this you need to have prepared the following: Two Radarr/Sonarr instances fully setup (Indexers, Custom Formats, Downloaders, etc). One download client ( Two if you prefer Usenet and Torrents ). Your download client has two separate categories (movies-hd, movies-uhd, tv-hd, tv-uhd, etc) Attention You can't use the same root (media library) folder for both Radarr's/Sonarr's Make sure you use two separate root folders in Radarr/Sonarr (movies-hd, movies-uhd, tv-hd, tv-uhd, etc) Option 1 In this example I'm going to use two Radarr instances (The basics is the same for Sonarr). Radarr 1 = My main 4K/2160p (UHD) Radarr. Radarr 2 = My 1080p Radarr that I've setup for a streaming optimized quality profile. 1 This option is best used if you want a 1:1 copy of your Radarr/Sonarr instances Adding the Radarr Sync list In Radarr 2 go to Settings => Lists Click on the + to add a list and select Radarr Then you get a screen with the following options: The name you want to call your Sync list. Enable to Enable the list. Enable so the movies will be automatically added. Enable so the movies will be added and monitored (if disabled then there will be no search done for the movies). Enable so Radarr will perform a search when a movie is added. When Radarr shall consider a movie as available. 2 The Quality Profile you want to use on Radarr 2 . Your root location for your media library. The Full URL to Radarr 1 (Use local URL if they run on the same system). Your API Key of Radarr 1 . Which Profile of Radarr 1 you want to Sync with Radarr 2 . Test the connection to Radarr 1 . Save your settings. Radarr Download client setup You don't need a separate download client for your two Radarr instances, this all can be done with one download client ( Two if you prefer Usenet and Torrents ). Settings => Download Clients Select your preferred download client. The only thing you need to change/create is a separate Category that you're going to use for Radarr 2 Attention This can't and shouldn't be the same category you use for Radarr 1 but a separate Category . How does this Radarr Sync work You now only need to make use of Radarr 1 . All movies you add to Radarr 1 will be synced to Radarr 2 at a scheduled time. Option 2 In this example I'm going to use two Sonarr instances (The basics is the same for Radarr). Sonarr 1 = My main 1080p WEB-DL Sonarr. Sonarr 2 = 4K/2160p (UHD) WEB-DL Sonarr. This option is best used if you only want to have a few TV shows (or movies if you use this option with Radarr) as 4K/2160p (UHD) Extra preparation In Sonarr 1 go to Settings => Profiles Clone your used profile and rename your profile from Profilename - Copy to Profilename! Adding the Sonarr Sync list In Sonarr 2 go to Settings => Import Lists Click on the + to add a list and select Sonarr Then you get a screen with the following options: The name you want to call your Sync list.
