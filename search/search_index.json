So I decided to fine tune it to try to get the releases &amp; quality I preferred. On Discord, I also noticed that others run in to the same issue so I explained them how I managed to get it solved. Being that I had to explain it often, I decided to write it down and make it public so I could easily link it to someone when they needed it. After a while I also decided to create guides for frequently asked questions, and started to collect all kind of information gathered from various sources. I try to make my guides as easy as possible for everyone to understand, in my opinion pictures explain often more than just some text.</p>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>If you have questions, suggestions, requests or want to contribute, click the chat badge to join the Discord Channel where you can ask your questions directly or use the following link to open an issue on GitHub.

(Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc)</p> <p>Q: Why do you prefer P2P groups over scene groups?</p> <p>A: Scene groups always release in a rush to bring it out as fast as possible.</p> <p>So I noticed often that I got Repacks/Proper releases from them or from different groups and quality. P2P releases are a bit smarter and work sort of together by not doing the same release. Also, I noticed that with some scene releases the 5.1 audio was stripped out or converted to AAC audio.</p> <p>In my opinion the P2P releases are of better quality. There's one scene group that does bring out quality releases <code>-deflate/-inflate</code>.</p> <p>Q: Why do I see so many repacks/propers of Amazon WEB-DLs lately?</p> <p>A: A large portion of Amazon WEB-DLs in the last week have only had 192Kbps DD+5.1, because that's all Amazon made available initially. The proper 640Kbps DD+5.1 audio might appear a few hours later or a few months, but when they get updated, the episodes will be REPACKED.</p> <p>Q: Why did you remove all the scene groups?</p> <p>A: I decided to redo the Release Profile to make it easier for me and the end user to update/manage the Release Profile. I decided not to add the scene groups anymore (and also removing the current ones). Why? Lately I noticed a lot of popup scene releases meaning we need to update often.</p> <p>With this it also means all scene and (yet) unknown groups will be getting a score of <code>0</code> and not <code>-50</code>.</p> <p>I will still keep a eye on them and add the Low Quality Groups to the <code>-100</code> score and when I find a new P2P group I will add them, resulting in less updates and a more accurate upgrade.</p>"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<p>This guide is based on WEBDL (Read the FAQ why) that's why we're going to create a quality profile based on WEBDL.</p> <p><code>Settings</code> =&gt; <code>Profiles</code></p> <p></p> <p>Select the profile that you want to use/prefer.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Starting from 2010 you will be able to find almost anything as WEBDL,</p> <p>2000-2010 you will only find a few shows as WEBDL in that case you might want to enable <code>HDTV</code> and or <code>720p</code>.</p> <p>If you want 2160p WEBDL then choose 2160p WEBDL and add the HDR and/or DV regex, 2160p without HDR/DV has no real benefits !!!</p>"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/#sonarr-current-logic","title":"Sonarr current logic","text":"Sonarr current logic - [CLICK TO EXPAND] <p>As of 2021-11-06 the logic is as follows:</p> <p>The Current logic on how downloads are compared is Quality Trumps All </p> <ol> <li>Quality</li> <li>Language</li> <li>Preferred Word Score</li> <li>Protocol</li> <li>Episode Count</li> <li>Episode Number</li> <li>Indexer Priority</li> <li>Seeds/Peers (If Torrent)</li> <li>Age (If Usenet)</li> <li>Size</li> </ol> <p>Source: Wiki Servarr</p> <p>REPACKS and PROPERs are v2 of Qualities and thus rank above a non-repack of the same quality.</p> <p><code>Settings</code> =&gt; <code>Media Management</code> =&gt; <code>File Management</code> =&gt; <code>Proper &amp; Repacks</code> Change to <code>Do Not Prefer</code> and use a preferred word regex of <code>/\\b(repack|proper)\\b/i</code></p>"},{"location":"Sonarr/Sonarr-Release-Profile-RegEx/#propers-and-repacks","title":"Propers and Repacks","text":"<p>First we're need to make sure a P2P release isn't being replaced by a Scene Repack/Proper release!</p> <p></p> <p>Go to <code>Settings</code> =&gt; <code>Media Management</code> We\u00b4re going to set it to <code>Do not Prefer</code>.</p> <p>Then we navigate to <code>Settings</code> =&gt; <code>Profiles</code> and click the plus sign.</p> <p></p> <p>You will get a popup screen that will look like this:</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p><code>Must Contain</code> =&gt; add words that the release name MUST HAVE!</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Must Not Contain</code> =&gt; add words that the release name MUST NOT HAVE OR IT WILL BE REJECTED!</p> </li> <li> <p><code>Preferred</code> =&gt; add words you prefer with a certain score.
