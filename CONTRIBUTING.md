# Contributing Guidelines

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

Here you will find a set of guidelines for contributing to [TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info/),
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Guidelines

- Make sure you're editing the latest version.
- If you propose changes make sure it doesn't break anything else in the Guides.
- Make sure that after the changes you don't get any [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md) errors
- If the `metadata.json` and `metadata.schema.json` needs changes, announce it first in the Discord `#development` channel and ping `voidpointer` and `nitsua` so the 3rd party apps don't break :bangbang:

## Branch naming

We're trying to be as consistent as possible for automation of the changelog.

- **feat/xxx** Commits, that adds a new feature
- **fix/xxx** Commits, that fixes a bug/issue
- **style/xxx** Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **chore/xxx** Miscellaneous commits (administrative / cleanup / backend)

Where 'xxx' can stand for Starr/Sonarr/Radarr/Guide etc

_Examples:_

- `feat/Starr-ELEANOR-to-Scene-CF`
- `feat/Radarr-CiNEPHiLES-to-Remux-Tier-02`
- `feat/maintenance`
- `fix/dv-hdr10-cf-should-match-dv-hdr10+`

## Pull Request naming

We're trying to be as consistent as possible for automation of the changelog.

- **feat(xxx):** Commits, that adds a new feature
- **fix(xxx):** Commits, that fixes a bug/issue
- **style(xxx):** Commits, that do not affect the meaning (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **chore(xxx):** Miscellaneous commits (administrative / cleanup / backend)

Where 'xxx' can stand for Starr/Sonarr/Radarr/Guide etc

_Examples:_

- `feat(starr): add ELEANOR to Scene CF`
- `feat(radarr): add CiNEPHiLES to Remux Tier 02`
- `feat(maintenance): various changes to the Starr CFs`
- `fix(starr): DV HDR10 CF should match DV HDR10+`

## When doing a PR that is WIP

When doing a PR that is in progress and not yet complete/ready for review or not yet done fully, please ensure it is a **DRAFT Pull Request**

## Radarr/Sonarr Custom Format (JSON)

### Release Group Reclassifications, Removals, or Additions

- When adding a release group to a Custom Format for whatever reason, please add in the PR why it's added/removed/moved.

### General Guidelines

- Custom Format name needs to match JSON name :bangbang:
- No hashcode can exist multiple times :bangbang:
- Tiers only hold release groups that have at least done several dozen objectively high-quality releases or are added for a specific reason. (If they do mainly niche stuff and/or foreign stuff they won't be added)
- All Tier Groups must use retail sources. Fanres and upscaled groups are forbidden. This is due to the high effort required and the near impossibility of guaranteeing quality systematically without manually checking every single movie.
- JSON file format shall consist of the following TRaSH-specific data appended to the JSON exported from Starr

```json
{
    "trash_id": "HASHCODE",
    "trash_scores": {
        "default": 50,
        "some_other_profile": 100
    },
    "trash_regex": "https://regex101.com/r/pADWJD/5",
STARRJSONEXPORT
}
```

General Structure

- JSON file name - name of the [json file](#file-naming)
- `trash_id` - Generated [HashCode](#hashcode) for the Custom Format
- `trash_scores` - JSON object of [score(s) for the Custom Format](#scoring). Note that Custom Formats with Default Scores of 0 should NOT have a `trash_scores.default`
- `trash_regex` - Link to [regex test cases](#regex-test-cases) for regex
- STARRJSONEXPORT - The exported custom format created within Starr. Note that this will have a leading `{` that will need to have the trash-specific regex added after it.

### File Naming

- JSON file names are always written in lowercase, spaces are replaced by a dash, and no spaces or special characters except a dash :bangbang:

### Hashcode

- When adding the hashcode for **Radarr** use the following naming `CF_name` e.g. the Custom Format `BR-DISK` would be the hash of [`BR-DISK`](https://md5.gromweb.com/?string=BR-DISK)
- When adding the hashcode for **Radarr Anime** use the following naming `Radarr Anime CF_name` e.g. the Custom Format `BR-DISK` would be the hash of [`Radarr Anime BR-DISK`](https://md5.gromweb.com/?string=Radarr+Anime+BR-DISK).
- When adding the hashcode for **Sonarr** use the following naming `Sonarr CF_name` e.g. the Custom Format `BR-DISK` would be the hash of [`Sonarr BR-DISK`](https://md5.gromweb.com/?string=Sonarr+BR-DISK).
- When adding the hashcode for **Sonarr Anime** use the following naming `Sonarr Anime CF_name` e.g. the Custom Format `BR-DISK` would be the hash of [`Sonarr Anime BR-DISK`](https://md5.gromweb.com/?string=Sonarr+Anime+BR-DISK).

### Regex Test Cases

- Provide a link to your regex example of your Custom Format using the following [Template](https://regex101.com/r/4DypIW/1).

When adding a regex test case:

- Replace the actual movie name with `Movie`.
- Replace the actual Series name/title with `Series`.
- Replace the actual group name with `RlsGrp`

When updating or adding a new CF the test case URL (`trash_regex`) needs to be prepended to the exported from Starr JSON

```json
{
    "trash_regex": "https://regex101.com/r/pADWJD/5"
}
```

### Scoring

- Scores must be added as JSON objects under `trash_scores`, for example:

```json
{
    "trash_scores": {
        "default": 50,
        "some_other_profile": 100
    }
}
```

- This allows for Custom Formats to be assigned different scores for different profiles
- Default Scores of 0 (e.g. as in `trash_scores.default`) are FORBIDDEN

## YAML file naming

- If a hashcode is needed **No** hashcode can exist multiple times :bangbang:
- Use [this website](https://md5.gromweb.com) to generate an md5 hash
- YAML file names are always written in small letters, spaces are replaced by a dash, and no spaces or special characters except a dash :bangbang:

## Recommendations

Use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing. VS Code should recommend extensions to you
based on the `.vscode/extensions.json` file; you should install all of them.

## Preview Docs Locally

### Prerequisites

These prerequisites are taken from the [mkdocs installation instructions][mkdocinstall].

- Install a recent version of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).
- `pip` is also required, but should come with Python. Run `pip --version` to check if it's available and working. See the [installation instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

[mkdocinstall]: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/

Alternatively you can check out the docker container maintained by [zakkarry](https://github.com/zakkarry) specifically for development of the guides [here](https://github.com/zakkarry/mkdocs). The documentation in the README explains the installation process.

### Mkdocs Installation

First, install mkdocs:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

Then, install dependent modules using the command below. This command should be run in the root
directory of the repository (i.e. where the `requirements.txt` file is). If the `pip` command does
not work, refer to the mkdocs installation page linked in the Prerequisite section above.

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

Once everything is installed, run the command below to start a local dev server to preview your
changes to mkdocs:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
