### Here you will find a collection of Setup Guides, Tips and Scripts  that I've made/collected.

Mainly for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr.
Including what's related to it.

------

The information I use for the tutorials/guides is information I gathered from different sources like there support forum, Reddit or Discord.
Provided by user input or from the develop team it self.
Most things I tested myself and tried to see if I could tune them a bit more to my needs and sometimes even for others.


If you have suggestions , requests or just want to leave some feedback please use the `issues` tracker on the top.

*Everything here you use on your own risk I won't be hold responsible if something happens to your collection!*
