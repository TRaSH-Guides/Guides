**ATMOS (undefined)**<br>

This custom format covers cases where _ONLY_ "Atmos" is specified in the release title, without noting DD+ (Lossy) or TrueHD (Lossless).

!!! note

    Apply the same score as Lossy (DD+) Atmos. On import, it will be updated to reflect either lossy or lossless based on the media's info using ffprobe.
