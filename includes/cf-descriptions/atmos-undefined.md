**ATMOS (undefined)**<br>

Handles cases where only Atmos is specified in title but not DD+ or TrueHD (Where it is not specified if it is Lossy or Lossless)

!!! note
    Give this the same score as Lossy Atmos, and then on import, it will get changed to either lossy or lossless based on mediainfo.
