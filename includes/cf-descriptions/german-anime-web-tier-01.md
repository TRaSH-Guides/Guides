**German Anime Web Tier 01**<br>

- **Source:** WEB-DL (Lossless download from top providers like AMZN, CR, NF, ADN).
- **Video:** Untouched Video Stream preferred. Always aim for the best available stream from the provider; note that the highest bitrate does not always equal the best visual quality. If encoded, it must have a good reason and be visually transparent or better (e.g. rescaling/filtering). There are few good reasons to reencode. Avoid fake 2160p/4K releases (especially from providers like Bilibili or iQIYI).
- **Audio:** Best available bitrate from the provider. Dual Audio (GER+JPN) or OmU (Original with Subs) if no Dub exists.
- **QC & Features:**
    - **Subtitles:** Format must be ASS/SSA. If source is VTT/TTML/SRT, it must be converted and properly styled (readable font, shadow/border). No raw text-based subs. If source is ASS, the subs should contain basic fixes like LayoutRes and set “ScaledBorderAndShadow: Yes”. If the release contains a dub, forced and full subtitles should be included.
    - **Chapters:** Mandatory. Named chapters preferred, but accurately generated markers are acceptable.
    - **Tags:** Clean metadata, correct language codes. Should follow MKV best practices.
    - **Fonts:** All used fonts must be attached. Attachment names should match the full font name (e.g., Times New Roman Bold.ttf instead of timesbd.ttf) to ensure maximum player compatibility.
