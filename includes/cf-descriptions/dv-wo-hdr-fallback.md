**DV (w/o HDR fallback)**<br>

If ^^**NOT**^^ every device accessing your media server supports Dolby Vision, add the DV (w/o HDR fallback) custom format to ensure maximum compatibility with your setup. This prevents playback issues on devices that don't fully support Dolby Vision.

<sub>*This also applies to Dolby Vision releases without HDR10 fallback (Profile 5).*</sub>
