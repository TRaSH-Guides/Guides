**x265**<br>

x265 is a *free software library* and *application* for encoding video streams into the [H.265/MPEG-H HEVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.265){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} compression format, and is released under the terms of the [GNU GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

This applies to all x265/HEVC releases that are not remux.

x265 is primarily used for 2160p encodes and for 1080p encodes that have HDR Formats included (DV, DV HDR10, HDR, etc.). x265 is good for 4K content or 1080p if they use the remuxes (untouched source) as the source. If the media isn't source quality or remux, then there will be a loss of quality. If you are storage-poor and just need to save space, use x265 (10-20% space-saving). The catch is that if you want the best quality x265, you need high-quality source files, so you will still have huge file sizes. It's a shame that many x265 groups microsize their releases or use x264 as a source, which results in low-quality releases. The few groups that do use the correct source suffer from it.
