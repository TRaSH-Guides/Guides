**DTS-HD MA**<br>

[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTS-HD_Master_Audio){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

DTS-HD Master Audio is a multi-channel lossless audio codec developed by DTS that extends the lossy DTS Coherent Acoustics codec (DTS CA; usually referred to as simply "DTS"). Rather than being an entirely new coding mechanism, DTS-HD MA encodes an audio master in lossy DTS first, then stores a concurrent stream of supplementary data representing whatever the DTS encoder discarded. This gives DTS-HD MA a lossy "core" able to be played back by devices that cannot decode the more complex lossless audio. DTS-HD MA's primary application is audio storage and playback for Blu-ray Disc media.
