**Special Edition**<br>

Custom format that matches various special editions (non-theatrical edition)

- The Director's Cut is the version edited by the Director, usually for additional home media releases.
- An Extended Cut is usually any version of the film that is longer than the theatrical cut (though in very rare cases, its shorter).
