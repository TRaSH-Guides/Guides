**Single Episode**<br>

!!! danger "This CF utilizes functionality only available starting in Sonarr v4.0.2.1262."

This Custom Format will recognize single-episode releases, instead of multi-episode or season packs, using Sonarr's built-in parser. Depending on your preference, you can give it a negative or positive score or skip adding it altogether.
