**Retags**<br>

Retags are often seen on public trackers, where the tracker or uploader adds their name to the torrent. They may also appear on some Usenet indexers.

- If you rely on public trackers, **DO NOT** use this Custom Format.
- Use this Custom Format **ONLY** if you **DO NOT** prefer Retagged releases.
