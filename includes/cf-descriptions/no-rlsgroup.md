**No-RlsGroup**<br>

Some indexers stripped out the release group, which could result in LQ groups receiving higher scores.
For example, many EVO releases are stripped of the group name, so they appear as "upgrades" and receive a decent score if other factors match.

!!! warning

    If you **DO NOT** use decent filenames (like not adding release groups), **DO NOT** add this Custom Format unless you want to upgrade them.
