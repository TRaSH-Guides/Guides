**Generated Dynamic HDR**<br>

- A collection of groups known for generating their own dynamic HDR metadataâ€”Dolby Vision and/or HDR10+.
- This generated dynamic HDR metadata does not come from official retail sources (discs or streaming services), so it is usually undesirable. Because of the substantial effort needed and the almost impossible task of reliably ensuring quality without reviewing each movie manually.
