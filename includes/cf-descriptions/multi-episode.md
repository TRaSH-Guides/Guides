**Multi-Episode**<br>

!!! danger "This CF utilizes functionality only available in Sonarr v4.0.2.1262 or later."

This Custom Format will recognize multi-episode releases (e.g. episodes named with 'S01E01E02'), instead of single-episode or season packs, using Sonarr's built-in parser. Depending on your preference, you can give it a negative or positive score or skip adding it altogether.
