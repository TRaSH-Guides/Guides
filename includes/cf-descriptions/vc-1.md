**VC-1**<br>

[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC-1){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

VC-1 is a video compression codec primarily developed by Microsoft. It is often associated with older Blu-ray discs and some HD digital video content. While VC-1 was a popular choice in the early days of HD content, it has been largely supplanted by more efficient codecs, such as AVC (H.264) for 1080p Remuxes and HEVC (H.265) for 2160p Remuxes.

When it comes to remuxing, many release groups upgrade older VC-1 encoded content to AVC (If a disc is released as AVC), especially for 1080p Remuxes. This is because AVC is generally more efficient in terms of compression while maintaining better quality at lower bitrates. As a result, content encoded with AVC will typically have improved visual quality and smaller file sizes compared to its VC-1 counterparts.

If you are looking for better quality versions of films or shows that were originally released in VC-1, it's common for modern remuxes to include AVC encoding, making them more compatible with current playback devices and ensuring a better viewing experience.
