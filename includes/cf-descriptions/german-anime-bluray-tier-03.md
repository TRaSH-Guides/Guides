**German Anime Bluray Tier 03**<br>

- **Source:** Direct BluRay Remux/BDMV, no Re-Encodes.
- **Video:** No filtering/basic encode approach. Can be fine on clean discs, but commonly carries over BD flaws (banding, chroma shift, bad/absent decimation with duplicates, rescale issues). Encoding artifacts are typically only noticeable on closer inspection, but underlying source issues remain.
- **Audio:** Typically original tracks (often bloated). Lossless-to-FLAC savings are usually not applied. Lossy audio remains untouched.
- **QC & Features:**
    - **Subtitles:** Raw BD-PGS common, limited typesetting, timing not optimized. Little/no OCR, little/no styling work.
    - **Chapters:** May be missing or pass-through only.
    - **Tags:** Messy or inconsistent naming/metadata more likely.
