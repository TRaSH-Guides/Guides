_This Custom Format will only match on_ `DV HDR10+`

This format provides Dolby Vision _with_ HDR10+ fallback (with HDR10+ having native HDR10 fallback).
You will find this mainly with:

- Hybrid Remuxes (_Hybrid isn't always mentioned_)
- Hybrid Bluray encodes (_Hybrid isn't always mentioned_)
- Hybrid WEB-DL (_Hybrid isn't always mentioned_)
