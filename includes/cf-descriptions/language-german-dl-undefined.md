**Language: German DL (undefined)**<br>

This Custom Format is mainly used to fix files that are wrongly named after import.

- For example, suppose the filename suggests it is only German but actually contains German and English audio.
- It is also useful for users who use a non-optimal file naming that does not follow suggested naming schemes
    - example: `John Wick Kapitel 2 (2017) [2160p] [HDR] [7.1, 7.1] [ger, eng] [Vio]`
