**DV (WEBDL)**<br>

The `DV (WEBDL)` custom format serves two important purposes:

- It ensures that the most compatible HDR formats are prioritized
- It excludes WEB-sourced Dolby Vision releases without an HDR base layer (Profile 5)

**When to use:** If not every device accessing your media server supports Dolby Vision, you should add the `DV (WEBDL)` custom format to prevent compatibility issues.
