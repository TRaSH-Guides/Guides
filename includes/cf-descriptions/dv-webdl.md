**DV (WEBDL)**<br>

!!! info "Use this Custom Format if Not all devices in your chain support Dolby Vision, You share your media library with other family members that don't have Dolby Vision compatible devices."

This is a special Custom Format that blocks WEBDLs **WITH** Dolby Vision but **WITHOUT** HDR10 fallback.

This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you would use to prefer Dolby Vision.

Most WEBDL from Streaming Services **DO NOT** have the fallback to HDR10. During playback, issues with weird colors (typically a green hue) can result when you attempt to play it on a non-Dolby Vision-compatible setup.

Remuxes and Bluray have a fallback to HDR10.
