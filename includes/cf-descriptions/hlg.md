*This Custom Format will only match on* `DV HLG`

**HLG**<br>

HLG or HLG10 is an HDR format created by NHK (JP) and the BBC that can be used for both video and still images. This format is backward compatible with SDR UHD TV, but not with older SDR displays that do not implement the Rec. 2020 color standards.

You will find this mainly with cable, satellite, and over-the-air TV broadcast series and movies from the likes of BBC and National Geographic.
