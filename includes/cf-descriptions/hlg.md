*This Custom Format will only match on* `DV HLG`

**HLG**<br>

HLG or HLG10 is an HDR format that can be used for both video and still images. The format is backwards compatible with SDR UHD TV but not with older SDR displays that do not implement the Rec. 2020 color standards.

You will find this mainly with Television Movies/Series like National Geographic.
