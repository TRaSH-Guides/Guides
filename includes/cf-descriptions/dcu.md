[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe_(streaming_service)>){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

DC Universe was an American subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) and digital comics service operated by DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Digital Networks, both divisions of WarnerMedia. Launched on September 15, 2018, the service featured a streaming library of animated series and films based on DC Comics properties, new original television series adapted from DC properties, as well as a rotating back catalogue of DC Comics publications, and online community features. In 2020.

In June 2020, WarnerMedia began to phase out DC Universe in favor of its new flagship streaming service HBO Max, initially by offering a promotional offer via DC Universe for new subscribers. DC Universe's original series and future streaming productions were moved to HBO Max and became Max Originals.
