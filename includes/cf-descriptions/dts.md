**DTS (Original DTS format – lossy)**<br>

Digital Theater Sound (DTS) is a digital audio technology developed by DTS, Inc, which focuses on digital surround sound formats for consumer and commercial applications as well as theatrical purposes. Compared to the Dolby Digital standard, DTS uses four times less compression and digitizes audio sounds at 20 bits instead of 16 bits. This makes DTS-based audio richer in sound and more detailed than Dolby Digital-based ones.
