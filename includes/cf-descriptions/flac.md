**FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec – lossless)**<br>

FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3 - but lossless, meaning that the audio compressed with FLAC does not receive any loss in quality. This is similar to how Zip works, except with FLAC you will get much better compression because it is designed specifically for audio.
