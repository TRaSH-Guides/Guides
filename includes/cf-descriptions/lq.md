**LQ**<br>

- A collection of known low-quality groups (often banned from the top trackers due to their lack of quality), banned or dishonest release groups, or rips/encodes from the scene and quick-to-release P2P groups that, while adequate, are typically not regarded as high quality.
- Release groups that disrupt the Starr apps automation because their poor naming could potentially create download loops, even if their overall quality is excellent.
