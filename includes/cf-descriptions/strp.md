[From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%2B){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Star+ (Star Plus; stylized as ST★R+) is a subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service available in almost all Ibero-American states. The service is owned by The Walt Disney Company through the Disney Entertainment division and business segment.

In December 2023, it was confirmed that Star+ will be merged into Disney+ in the second quarter of 2024 with all of its content, including live sports from ESPN, migrating to Disney+ and its standalone app being discontinued.
