This custom format helps Radarr/Sonarr recognize German Dual Language audio releases.

- Add this Custom Format with the default score of `-10000` to prevent getting releases that include `German + Original audio`.
- Add this Custom Format with a score of +`10001` if you prefer releases that include `German + Original audio`,  It will add `German DL` to your filename.
