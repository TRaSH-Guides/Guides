**4K Remaster**<br>

A remastered or mastered in 4K should give you usually the best picture and audio currently for the movie. Both are just names to describe the best possible current release of the movie.

To be clear, the final digital films on the Mastered in 4K Blu-rays still only have the same 1920 x 1080 pixels of actual resolution as normal Blu-rays. But the argument goes that because these full HD files were derived from higher-resolution masters, their images will be more precise, with better colors, less noise, and enhanced sharpness and detail. Not least because the higher-resolution mastering process will provide more detail from the original print for the Blu-ray masters to draw on when going through their (hopefully…) frame-by-frame compression process.

Another important element of the Mastered in 4K discs is that they’re all mastered with ‘x.v.YCC’ color specification. This delivers an expanded color range closer to that contained in source material.
