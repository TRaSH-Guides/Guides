**Bad dual groups**<br>

These groups take the original release and add their language (e.g., Portuguese) as the main audio track (AAC 2.0). After renaming and FFprobe, the media file will be recognized as Portuguese AAC audio. Adding the best audio as the first track is a common rule. They also often translate or rename the release name to Portuguese.
