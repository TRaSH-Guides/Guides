**German Anime Bluray Tier 02**<br>

- **Source:** Direct BluRay Remux/BDMV, no Re-Encodes.
- **Video:** Casual filtering (debanding, de-/regraining, anti-aliasing, dehaloing). Improvements are visible, but the release typically does not (consistently) address heavier BD issues like chroma shift, bad decimation/duplicate-frame patterns, or rescale problems.
- **Audio:** Lossless may be kept as-is or converted losslessly to FLAC. Lossy audio is not re-encoded.
- **QC & Features:**
  - **Subtitles:** OCR'd BD subs or Web-subs included, basic readability styling expected. Raw PGS is acceptable. Fonts may or may not be attached.
  - **Chapters:** Usually present, can be basic.
  - **Tags:** Mostly correct, occasional inconsistencies.
