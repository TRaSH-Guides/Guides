**German Anime Web Tier 02**<br>

- **Source:** WEB-DL or high-quality WEBRip (from reputable sources).
- **Video:** Untouched streams or high-quality encodes (preferably H.265/HEVC or H.264). Must be free of obvious artifacts (blocking, heavy noise) and maintain visual integrity.
- **Audio:** Standard streams (AAC/E-AC3). Dual Audio or OmU accepted.
- **QC & Features:**
    - **Subtitles:** ASS or SRT included. Must be readable. If using SRT, correct encoding (UTF-8) is mandatory to avoid broken characters.
    - **Chapters:** Basic markers are highly encouraged, but not strictly mandatory if the source lacks them.
    - **Tags:** Proper filenames following scene or p2p “standards”. Correct language tags for audio and subtitle tracks are expected for player automation.
