**German Anime Bluray Tier 01**<br>

- **Source:** Direct BluRay Remux/BDMV, no Re-Encodes.
- **Video:** Advanced filtering that *fixes* known BD problems where present, e.g. banding, rescale-issues, chroma shift, wrong/missing decimation, duplicate-frame patterns - plus the usual debanding, de-/regraining, anti-aliasing, dehaloing. Filters must improve the image to avoid nuking detail (no over-strong filtering).
- **Audio:** Lossless preserved, but de-bloated where sensible - e.g. DTS-HD MA/PCM -> FLAC (often ~50% smaller). If the source is pointless-bloated (e.g. random 24-bit tracks), normalization to a practical lossless target (commonly 16-bit FLAC) is acceptable within this tier's logic. Lossy tracks (AC3, etc.) are not re-encoded.
- **QC & Features:**
    - **Subtitles:** ASS/SSA preferred. Best case: properly typeset Web-subs (e.g. CR) when available and correctly synced. Otherwise: high-quality OCR of BD-PGS with readable styling (border/shadow) and sensible timing alignment. Raw PGS only if unavoidable. Fonts attached where needed.
    - **Chapters:** Present (from disc or accurately transferred).
    - **Tags:** Clean metadata, correct language codes, correct track naming, fonts attached for ASS.
