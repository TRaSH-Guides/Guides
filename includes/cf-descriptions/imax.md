**IMAX**<br>

[From In Depth Cine](https://www.indepthcine.com/videos/imax){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

IMAX films are shot in tall aspect ratios, typically 1.9:1 or sometimes 1.43:1. Most IMAX film releases also have scenes shot at wider aspect ratios and, as a result, the aspect ratio will change throughout. Because they are shot on large format cameras, there is often less film grain present. This results in a clearer picture.
