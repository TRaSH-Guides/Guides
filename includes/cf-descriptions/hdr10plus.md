**HDR10+**<br>

HDR10+ makes this metadata dynamic, allowing it to change for each frame of video. This means every frame is treated to its own set of colors, brightness, and contrast parameters, making for a much more realistic-looking image. Areas of the screen that might have been over saturated under HDR10 will display their full details with HDR10+.
