**HDR10+**<br>

HDR10+ improves upon HDR10 by making its metadata dynamic, allowing for it to change for each frame of video. This means every frame is adjusted to its own set of colors, brightness, and contrast parameters, making for a much more vibrant and realistic-looking image. Areas of the screen that might have been over-saturated with HDR10 will display their full contrast and detail with HDR10+.
