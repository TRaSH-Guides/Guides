**Dolby Vision**<br>

Dolby Vision is a dynamic HDR format.
It can offer better visual experiences relative to HDR10. The most significant difference is that it uses dynamic metadata which allows varying brightness levels within HDR content which enables filmmakers to have more precise control over the overall image appearance. HDR10 relies on static metadata which limits the HDR effect to a per-movie or per-episode basis.
