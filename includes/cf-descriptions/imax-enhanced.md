**IMAX Enhanced**<br>

**Get more picture and fewer black bars (letterboxing).**

[From Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-imax-enhanced/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

IMAX Enhanced is a standard for digital releases. It features scenes shot on IMAX cameras and produced in HDR10 DV. IMAX Enhanced releases often have a higher bitrate than other WEB options and are encoded into various formats, including SDR conversions.

Due to the higher bitrate and implied picture quality improvement, it is recommended that the IMAX Enhanced custom format be enabled on WEB profiles, especially for those seeking 'The IMAX Experience'â€”including fewer "black bars" or letterboxing.
