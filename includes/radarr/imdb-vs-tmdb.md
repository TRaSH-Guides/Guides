While both IMDb and TMDb IDs are unique, TMDb can occasionally remove IDs entirely, sometimes only to be re-added with a new ID later. However, due to using TMDb as its metadata source, they can be seen as "more aligned" with Radarr. IMDb IDs on the other hand, once present, are very accurate and rarely ever change.
