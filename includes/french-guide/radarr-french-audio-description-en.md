??? abstract "Audio Description - [Click to show/hide]"

    Some releases are now available with Audio Description, which is way for visually impaired people to enjoy their media.
    Those are flagged `WiTH.AD` or just `AD`, and not be confused with advertisements as they are not.

    If you want to prefer those for any reasons, please add the following CF with a score of `101`. You can still use it for information if you decide to not score it.
