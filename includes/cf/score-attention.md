!!! warning "Attention"

    All the used scores and combination of Custom Formats in this Guide are tested to get the desired results and prevent download loops as much as possible.

    From experience most of the time when people change scores or leave out certain CF that work together they end up with undesired results.

    If you're unsure or have questions do not hesitate to ask for help on Discord
