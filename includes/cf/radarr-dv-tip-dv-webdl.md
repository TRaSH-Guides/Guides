    If you (or family members you share your collection with) have a setup that doesn't support Dolby Vision then it's best to add <br> **ALL** the HDR Formats listed above (including **ALL** the DV ones (with and without HDR in it)). <br> It is important to also add the [{{ radarr['cf']['dv-webdl']['name'] }}](/Radarr/Radarr-collection-of-custom-formats/#dv-webdl) Custom Format with a score of {{ radarr['cf']['dv-webdl']['trash_scores']['default'] }}
