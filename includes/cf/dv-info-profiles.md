    Dolby Vision Profiles

    - **Profile 5** <sup>(*1*)</sup> - This is what comes with WEB-DL Dolby Vision releases without HDR10 fallback.<br>(*Incompatible devices will playback with blown out pinks and greens*)
    - **Profile 7** <sup>(*2*)</sup> - This is what comes with UHD Bluray Remuxes and UHD BluRay releases.<br>*These files will play on an Nvidia Shield Pro (2019), but on most other players will revert to the HDR10 fallback.*
    - **Profile 8** <sup>(*3*)</sup> - This is what comes with (Hybrid) WEB-DL (HULU), Hybrid UHD Remux, and UHD BluRay releases (all of which have HDR10 fallback).<br>*This works with several mainstream media players.*<br>

    !!! bug "It is too technical to explain in detail, so I'll keep it short with tested facts: <br>PLEX for AppleTV and Plex with Infuse only support CMv2.9."

    There are two versions of Dolby Vision, namely CMv2.9 and CMv4.0. CMv4.0 uses an improved algorithm and a superior tone curve that allows for better mapping and more controls during the Dolby Vision trim pass process.
