!!! bug "Plex for Apple TV and Plex with Infuse will only play profiles 5 and 8 correctly if CMv2.9 is used.<br>This is something that can't be determined beforehand.<br>So whether using an Apple TV with or without Infuse, it will always be hit or miss if the content will be playable.<br>Additionally, it is uncertain whether the Dolby Vision layer will play or if it will fall back to HDR10, or if you may encounter a black screen."
