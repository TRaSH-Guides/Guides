??? bug "Apple TV Dolby Vision Limitations - [Click to show/hide]"
    Plex for Apple TV is only capable of playing Dolby Vision Profiles 5 and 8 correctly if CMv2.9 is being used.<br>Infuse 7.7.2+ offers expanded support for Dolby Vision Profile 8, including files containing CMv4.0 metadata, samples that were previously playing with a black screen, falling back to HDR10, or various other playback issues. [SOURCE](https://community.firecore.com/t/infuse-7-7-2-now-available/48208){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<br>The Dolby Vision Profile and Version of a media file cannot be determined by automation software before downloading it, so when you are using an Apple TV, with or without Infuse, it will always be hit or miss whether the content is compatible or not.<br>Additionally, it is uncertain whether the Dolby Vision layer will play, fall back to HDR10, or result in a black screen.

    - <sup>(*1*) *PLEX for Apple TV and Plex with Infuse will only play profile 5 correctly if CMv2.9 is used.*</sup>
    - <sup>(*2*) *Neither Infuse nor PLEX for Apple TV will deliver real Dolby Vision with Profile 7.*</sup>
    - <sup>(*3*) *PLEX for Apple TV will only play profile 8 correctly if CMv2.9 is used. However, we have also received reports that in some cases, it will fall back to HDR10, or you may encounter a black screen.*<br><br>To prevent your TV from incorrectly indicating that it is playing DV follow the steps provided by an Infuse user:**<br>“With Infuse ensure you set the Extended Dolby Vision settings to Limited (prefer accuracy), convert P8 to P5 (when possible), and play other P8 as HDR (output will switch to either DoVi or HDR depending on the video)”**</sup>
