!!! bug "Plex for Apple TV is only capable of playing Dolby Vision Profiles 5 and 8 correctly if CMv2.9 is being used.<br>Infuse 7.7.2+ offers expanded support for Dolby Vision Profile 8, including files containing CMv4.0 metadata, samples that were previously playing with a black screen, falling back to HDR10, or various other playback issues. [SOURCE](https://community.firecore.com/t/infuse-7-7-2-now-available/48208){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<br>The Dolby Vision Profile and Version of a media file cannot be determined by automation software before downloading it, so when you are using an Apple TV, with or without Infuse, it will always be hit or miss whether the content is compatible or not.<br>Additionally, it is uncertain whether the Dolby Vision layer will play, fall back to HDR10, or result in a black screen."
