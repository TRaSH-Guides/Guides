!!! bug "Plex for Apple TV and Plex with Infuse is only capable of playing Dolby Vision profiles 5 and 8 correctly if CMv2.9 is being used.<br>This is something that cannot be determined beforehand.<br>So whether you are using an Apple TV, with or without Infuse, it will always be hit or miss whether the content is compatible.<br>Additionally, it is uncertain whether the Dolby Vision layer will play, fall back to HDR10, or encounter a black screen."
