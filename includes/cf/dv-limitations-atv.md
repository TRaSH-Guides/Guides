!!! bug "Plex for Apple TV is only capable of playing Dolby Vision profiles 5 and 8 correctly if CMv2.9 is being used.<br>Infuse 7.7.2+ includes expanded support for Dolby Vision (Profile 8). This includes support for files which include CMv4.0 metadata, and samples which were previously playing with a black screen, falling back HDR, or exhibiting other various playback issues. [SOURCE](https://community.firecore.com/t/infuse-7-7-2-now-available/48208){:target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}<br>This is something that cannot be determined beforehand.<br>So whether you are using an Apple TV, with or without Infuse, it will always be hit or miss whether the content is compatible.<br>Additionally, it is uncertain whether the Dolby Vision layer will play, fall back to HDR10, or encounter a black screen."
