!!! info "Dolby Vision is available in several profiles"

    - Profile 5 - This is what comes with WEB-DL Dolby Vision release without HDR10 fallback.<br> On a AppleTV, these do not reliably play with the Plex app but will work better with the third-party Infuse app. MP4 files tend to work better than MKV files, obviously MKV is preferable because of its support for lossless audio. (*Incompatible devices will playback with blown out pinks and greens*)
    - Profile 7 - This is what comes with HD Bluray Remuxes.<br>These files will play on an Nvidia Shield (2019), but on most other players will revert to the HDR10 fallback.
    - Profile 8 - This is what comes with (Hybrid) WEB-DL releases (HULU), Hybrid UHD Remux and UHD BluRay releases - all of which have HDR10 fallback.<br>This works with several mainstream media players,<br> but the AppleTV can only play the HDR10 fallback. (*although your TV will incorrectly say that it is playing DV*).

    **Meaning: Neither Infuse nor PLEX for AppleTV will deliver real Dolby Vision with Profile 7/8.**
