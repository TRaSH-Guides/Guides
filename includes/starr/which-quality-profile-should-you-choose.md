## Which Quality Profile should you choose

??? abstract "Which Quality Profile should you choose - [Click to show/hide]"

    The guides and profiles are built for high-quality sources, specifically those based on formats like WEB-DL, Blu-ray, or Remuxes. These sources prioritize excellent video and audio quality, not small file sizes.

    For example, a high-quality, extended version of *The Lord of the Rings* cannot be compressed to a small size, such as 2-4 GB, without significant quality loss.

    The size of a media file is directly related to the quality of the source (WEB-DL, Blu-ray, or Remuxes) and the running time. If you want the highest quality, you shouldn't worry about file size.

    !!! info "Many people think that TRaSH Guides dislikes x265 releases. **We DO NOT.** We simply dislike the reasoning behind why most x265 groups and users use them. More info [HERE](/Misc/x265-4k/)."

    <h2>Choose a profile based on:</h2>

    **Hardware compatibility**

    - Ensure BOTH your TV and media player support the formats you select. For example, if you want to play media in Dolby Vision (DV) but have a Samsung TV, it will ONLY play HDR10 (this is a Samsung TV limitation).

    **Device capabilities**

    - Avoid playing high bitrate media on underpowered devices (like smart TV apps).

    **Network limitations**

    - Consider bandwidth constraints, such as WiFi connections that may be unreliable or cause buffering issues due to inconsistent speeds
    - Account for built-in network ports on TVs that are often limited to 100 Mbps

    **Transcoding requirements**

    - If you continually need to transcode video content, you've probably chosen the wrong profile. Consider selecting a different profile that allows direct playback without video transcoding.
    - Audio transcoding has minimal resource impact, so it shouldn't be a major concern unless you're running your media server on a low-powered device.

    These are all factors to consider when choosing your profile.
