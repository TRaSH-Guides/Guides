!!! info

    The order listed in the profile matters even if a quality is not checked, for example if you have a 1080p version but wanted the SD version, Radarr will reject all SD results because 1080p is listed higher than SD even though 1080p was not checked.

    Qualities at the top of the list will appear first in manual searches.

    - Qualities higher in the list are more preferred even if not checked.
    - Qualities within the same group are equal.
    - Only checked qualities are wanted.

    This is why it's recommended to move the selected quality to the top of the list.
