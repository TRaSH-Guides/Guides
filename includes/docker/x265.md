!!! info "Many people think that TRaSH Guides dislikes x265 releases. We **DO NOT**. We simply dislike the reasoning behind why most x265 groups and users use them."

This applies to all x265/HEVC releases that are not remux.

x265 is primarily used for 2160p encodes and for 1080p encodes that include HDR Formats (DV, DV HDR10, HDR, etc.). x265 is suitable for 4K content or 1080p if they use remuxes (untouched source) as the source. If the used media isn't source quality or remux, then quality will be lost. If you are storage-poor and just need to save space, use x265 (10-20% space-saving). The catch is that if you want the best quality from x265, you need high-quality source files, so you will still have large file sizes.

#### Microsized & Wrong Source

It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize their releases or use x264 as a source, which results in low-quality releases. The few groups that do use the correct source suffer because of it.

#### Golden Rule

Thatâ€™s the reason we created our own guiding principle aka The Golden Rule

- 720/1080p => x264
- 2160p/4k => x265
