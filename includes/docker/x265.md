    x265 is good for 4k stuff or 1080p (if they used the the remuxes as source).
    If the media isn't source quality/remux, then there will be a loss of
	quality every time. Also, once you go x265, that file usually can't
	be changed to something else without a huge loss of quality.

    Something like 95% of video files are x264 and have much better direct play 
    support. If you have more than a couple users, you will notice much more
	transcoding. Just depends on your priorities.

    Basically, If you are storage poor and need to save space, use x265.
    The catch is if you want best quality x265, you need source quality files,
	so you still have huge file sizes. If you want maximum compatibility and
	the option to change your files to something else later, then x264.
    It's all really dependent on specific situations for different people.

#### Microsized & Wrong Source

It's a shame that most x265 groups microsize the releases (or use the x264 as
source), which results in low quality releases. As a result, the few groups
that do use the correct source suffer from it.

#### Golden Rule

Because of all this, I created my own golden rule:

- 720/1080p => x264
- 2160p/4k => x265
