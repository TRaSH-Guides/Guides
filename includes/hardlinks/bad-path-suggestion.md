### Bad path suggestion

!!! warning "The default path setup suggested by some docker developers that encourages people to use mounts like `/movies`, `/tv`, `/books` or `/downloads` because it is easy to get started this way. However, this is suboptimal, as it makes the folders look like two or three separate file systems (like separate storage disks), even if they aren’t (*because of how Docker’s volumes work*). While easy to use, the separate file systems method has a major drawback: You lose the ability to hardlink or instant move, resulting in a slower and more I/O intensive copy + delete is used."
