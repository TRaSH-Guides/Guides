    1. Language
    1. Preferred Word Score
    1. Protocol
    1. Episode Count
    1. Episode Number
    1. Indexer Priority
    1. Seeds/Peers (If Torrent)

    !!! warning ""

        REPACKS and PROPERs are v2 of Qualities and thus rank above a non-repack of the same quality.

        `Settings` => `Media Management` => `File Management` => `Proper & Repacks` Change to `Do Not Prefer` and use a preferred word regex of `/\b(repack|proper)\b/i`
