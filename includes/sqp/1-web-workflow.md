## Workflow Logic

??? abstract "Workflow Logic - [Click to show/hide]"

    **Depending what's released first and available the following Workflow Logic will be used:**

    - When a 1080p WEBDL is released it will be downloaded.
    - When a 1080p BHDStudio/hallowed is released it won't be grabbed as an upgrade.
    - If no 1080p WEBDL can be found, a 1080p BHDStudio or hallowed release will be preferred (where the hallowed will be preferred over BHDStudio).
    - If no 1080p WEBDL or 1080p BHDStudio/hallowed can be found, a 1080p Bluray encode will be grabbed, although these can be less - or not at all - streaming optimized.
    - Releases with 2.0 audio will be scored lower, so a WEB Tier 01 could be trumped by a BHDStudio or any other HD Bluray Tier 03 that has, for example, 5.1 audio.

    *Possible Variables*

    - Prefer 1080p WEBDL with IMAX-E.
