## Why choose this quality profile

??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You got a decent audio setup. (that supports all HD audio formats)
    - You got a setup that completely supports DoVi from start to end.
    - You do want the highest quality as possible to watch but want to save space for archiving without losing video and audio quality.
    - HDR/DoVi (Depending what's offered and often both)
    - HD Audio (Atmos, TrueHD etc...)
