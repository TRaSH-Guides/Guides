## Why choose this quality profile

??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You have a decent audio setup that supports all HD audio formats (Atmos, TrueHD, etc).
    - You have a TV that supports enhanced HDR formats, (DV and/or HDR10+).
    - You want the highest possible quality to watch but want to also save space for archiving without giving up video and audio quality.
    - You don't want to wait longer for the HQ Encodes to be released.
