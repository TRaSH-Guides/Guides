??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You want 2160p with DV + HDR10 but don't care about HD audio (TrueHD, DTS-HD, DTS-X).
    - You want maximum compatibility across all devices and still a HQ release.
    - You run 2 instances of Radarr and want both version or you want to use this as your main.
    - You want to have little to no transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming.
    - You're using your smart tv app as media player device.
    - You want to grab streaming optimized releases.
