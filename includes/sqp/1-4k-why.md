## Why choose this quality profile

??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You want 2160p with DV + HDR10 but don't care about HD audio (TrueHD, DTS-HD, DTS-X).
    - You want maximum compatibility across all devices and still a HQ release.
    - You run 2 instances of Radarr and want both version or you want to use this as your main.
    - You want to have little to no transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming.
    - You're using your smart tv app as media player device.
    - You want to grab streaming optimized releases.

    BHDStudio does HQ 1080p/2160p Encodes with the following features

    - Streaming optimized (Optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms)
    - [1080p] AC3 Audio (Downmixed Lossless audio track to Dolby Digital 5.1 for optimal compatibility)
    - [2160p] Encoded lossless audio track to Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 with Dolby Digital 5.1 fallback.
    - [2160p] Dolby Vision with HDR10 fallback or HDR10 if there is no DV HDR10 release.
    - Small sizes
    - Good quality

    Biggest drawback: If you don't have access to the top tier indexers you won't have access to all BHDStudio releases, and you will end up with less or not streaming optimized releases.
