    - When a 1080p WEBDL is released it will be downloaded. (streaming services)
    - When a 1080p BHDStudio is released it will download the BHDStudio release.
    - If no 1080p BHDStudio or 1080p WEBDL can be found (not existing or limited sources) it will download a 1080p Bluray encode (less or not streaming optimized).
