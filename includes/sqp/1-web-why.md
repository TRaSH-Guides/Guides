## Why choose this quality profile

??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You run a second 'Streaming Optimized' instance of Radarr and want both versions, or you just want streaming-optimized 1080p overall.
    You want fewer upgrades than with SQP-1 because the WEBDL has often been watched before the BHDstudio Blu-ray is released.
    - You want good compatibility across various playback devices without compromising release quality.
    - You want little to no transcoding for low-powered devices or remote streaming.
    - Smaller file sizes and bitrates.
    - Easier to get even without access to top-tier trackers/indexers.
    - You prefer Dolby Digital Plus (Atmos) audio over Dolby Digital, as WEB-DLs commonly come with Dolby Digital Plus (Atmos) audio.
    - You prefer Imax-Enhanced.
    - You prefer included embedded subs.
    - More cross-seed hits, as WEBDL is more spread out over the trackers.
