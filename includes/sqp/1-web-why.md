## Why choose this quality profile

??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You want good compatibility across a range of playback devices without compromising on release quality.
    - You run a second 'Streaming Optimized' instance of Radarr and want both versions, or just want streaming optimized 1080p overall.
    - You want to have little to no transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming.
    - You want to grab releases optimized for streaming.
    - Smaller file sizes and bitrates.
    - Once a WEB release is grabbed, you don't need it to 'upgrade' to a BHDStudio release (see below).

    BHDStudio does HQ 1080p Encodes with the following features:

    - Streaming optimized (Optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms)
    - AC3 Audio (Downmixed Lossless audio track to Dolby Digital 5.1 for optimal compatibility)
    - Small sizes
    - Good quality

    If you don't have access to the top tier indexers, you won't have access to all BHDStudio releases. WEB releases, however, have much better general availability.
