    - You want maximum compatibility across all devices and still a HQ release.
    - You run 2 instances of Radarr and want both versions or just the 1080p ones.
    - You want to have little to no transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming.
    - You want to grab streaming optimized releases.
    - Small sizes.

    - Streaming optimized (Optimized for PLEX, emby, Jellyfin, and other streaming platforms)
    - AC3 Audio (Downmixed Lossless audio track to Dolby Digital 5.1 for optimal compatibility)
