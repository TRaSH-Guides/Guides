## Important Notice

!!! warning "Important Notice"

    All the used scores and combinations of Custom Formats in this Guide are tested to get the desired results while preventing download loops as much as possible.

    From experience, most of the time when people change scores or leave out certain CFs that work together - they end up with undesired results.

    If you're unsure or have questions, do not hesitate to ask for help on Discord
