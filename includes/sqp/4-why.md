## Why choose this quality profile

??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You have a setup that completely supports DoVi from start to end.
    - HDR/DoVi (Depending on what's offered and often both)
    - If available HD Audio (Atmos, TrueHD etc...)
    - You're okay with WEB-DL, with the option to upgrade to IMAX Enhanced.
    - You don't need the huge Remuxes or UHD Bluray Encodes but still want HDR Formats.
    - You want smaller files for your kid's movies (Disney/Pixar etc)
