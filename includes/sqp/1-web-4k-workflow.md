## Workflow Logic

??? abstract "Workflow Logic - [Click to show/hide]"

    **Depending on what is released first and available, the following Workflow Logic will be used, where 2160p will be preferred:**

    - When a 1080p/2160p WEBDL is released, it will be downloaded.
    - When a 1080p/2160p BHDStudio/hallowed is released, it won't be grabbed as an upgrade.
    - If no 1080p/2160p WEBDL can be found, a 1080p/2160p BHDStudio or hallowed release will be preferred (where the hallowed will be preferred over BHDStudio).
    - If no 1080p/2160p WEBDL or 1080p/2160p BHDStudio/hallowed can be found, a 1080p/2160p Bluray encode will be grabbed, although these may be less - or not at all - streaming optimized.
    - Releases with 2.0 audio will be scored lower, so a WEB Tier 01 could be trumped by a BHDStudio or any other HD Bluray Tier 03 that has, for example, 5.1 audio.

    *Possible Variables*

    - Prefer 1080p/2160p WEBDL with IMAX-E.
    - Leave out 1080p if you use SQP-1 (1080p)/SQP-1 WEB (1080p) as your main/other Radarr.
