## Why choose this quality profile

??? question "Why choose this quality profile? - [Click to show/hide]"

    - You got a decent audio setup. (that supports all HD audio formats)
    - You got a setup that completely supports DoVi from start to end.
    - HDR/DoVi (Depending what's offered and often both)
    - HD Audio (Atmos, TrueHD etc...)
    - You want the highest quality possible, with the option to upgrade to IMAX Enhanced.
