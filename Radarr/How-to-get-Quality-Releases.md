#### Description

This Guide/Tutorial is mainly for people that watch there movies on a big Full HD TV, 4K TV or even a projector,

**Or did you buy your big screen to watch DVD's quality or worse ?**

If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you.

We will make use of Radarr Restrictions and of the Custom Format option.
The info has been collected from different major sites.
I'll be using a list of group names (most of them are also banned on them) and words to filter out those releases.
Quality Releases (Bad Quality (Video or Audio wise), Wrongly Tagged or Re-Tagged).
